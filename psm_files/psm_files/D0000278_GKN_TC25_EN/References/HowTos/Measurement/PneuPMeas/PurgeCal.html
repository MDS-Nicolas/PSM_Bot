<p>This <strong>How To</strong> provides the steps required to purge and zero the pressure scanners.</p>
<h2>To Purge and Zero the Pressure Scanners</h2>
<p class="Warning">The Pneumatic Pressure Measurement system operates at high pressures. Personnel must be briefed on the system operation. Wear safety glasses when making or breaking quick disconnects or other pressure connections. Stay clear of the pressure lines if the pressure lines are being purged.</p>
<p class="Warning">To prevent serious injury and or irreparable damage to equipment, observe the manufacturer's maintenance and repair guidelines and precautions. </p>
<p class="Caution">To prevent injury and damage to scanners, do not purge the scanners with  installed dust caps or a sealed measurement port. Turn off the purge supply pressure before applying power to the scanners.</p>
<p class="Note">Purging and zeroing should be performed on the pressure scanners before each engine test.</p>
<h3>Pressure Scanners Purging and Zeroing</h3>
<p>The <a href="../../../../proDASHelp/CustomApps/InstrumentControls/InstrumentControls.htm#AccessPBFunctionsPanel">Pressure  Scanner Functions Panel</a> on the proDAS <a href="../../../../CompCfg/MgmtPC/MgmtPCOverview.html">Management GUI Computer</a> controls the purging and zeroing   functions on the pressure scanners.</p>
<h3>Purge</h3>
<p>Purging cleans the lines between the scanners and engine using purge air to ensure proper functioning of the equipment. Scanner purging is  controlled from the Management GUI <a href="../../../../proDASHelp/CustomApps/InstrumentControls/InstrumentControls.htm">Pressure Scanner Functions Panel</a>. One or all scanners (in groups) can be selected for purge. During purging, the transducers in a scanner are isolated from the scanner input ports by an internal manifold, and the pressure ports are connected to the purge supply. Sufficient purge air must be supplied to ensure proper purging of the equipment.</p>
<p class="Caution">To prevent damage to scanners, remove dust caps and measurement port seals from the scanners before purging.</p>
<p class="Caution">To prevent contamination in the purge port, cap the purge port on the scanners when the purge feature is not used.</p>
<p class="Note">Supply pressure must be between 80 to 120 PSI to ensure proper operation of scanners, when switching between purging, zeroing and measurement modes. Supply and purge air for the scanners is provided by the auxiliary air system. </p>
<p>To purge the scanner(s):</p>
<ol>
  <li>From the Management GUI Control Panel <strong>Tools</strong> menu, select&nbsp; <strong>Pre Test Functions</strong> and then PBS.<br>
  The Pressure Scanner Functions window is displayed.<br>
  <img src="images/PurgePanel.gif" width="404" height="344" alt=""/>  </li>
  <li> Enter the duration of the purge (in seconds) in the <strong>Purge Time</strong> field of the Pressure Scanner Functions panel.</li>

<p class="Note">The default purge time is 30 seconds. The purge is dependent on the number of scanners and the length of the lines and should be long enough to purge all the pressure  lines before switching to measurement mode.</p>

  <li>To purge all scanners:   
    <ol type="a">
      <li> click <strong>Purge All Scanners</strong>.<strong><br>
        </strong> A dialogue box is displayed,  indicating the scanners are being purged.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="Note">It is not recommended to purge all the scanners at once. Purge only a few at a time to ensure that the purge pressure is high enough to purge the lines completely. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <li>To purge one or more scanners:</li>
</ol>
<ol>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>Click <strong>Purge One Scanner</strong>.</li>
    <li>From the Pressure Scanner Functions panel, select the name of the channel(s)  to be purged.</li>
    </ol>
  <blockquote class="Note">To purge multiple scanners, select  all of the channels belonging to the  desired scanners.</blockquote>
  <ol type="a" start="3">
    <li>Click <strong>Start</strong>.<br>
    A dialogue box is displayed,  indicating the scanners are being purged.</li>
  </ol>
</ol>
  <p>When all scanners have been purged,  the dialogue box is closed and the operator is returned to the Pressure Scanner  Functions window. The pressure channels are returned to their normal  measurement mode.</p>

<h3>Scanner Zero Calibration</h3>
<p>The <strong>Zero All Bricks</strong> function performs a zero calibration on  the configured pressure scanners at the  same time. The function creates an offset coefficient for the data channels in the scanner. The coefficient compensates for drift in the output of the scanner transducers. The command moves the internal calibration valve in the scanner from the RUN to the CAL position. The pressure that is present at the CAL and the  CAL REF inputs is used for zeroing the scanners. After  zero calibration is completed, the valve is moved back to the RUN position and the offset coefficients are updated in the pressure scanner memory.</p>
<p>To zero the scanner(s):</p>
<ol>
  <li>From the Management GUI Control Panel <strong>Tools</strong> menu, select&nbsp; <strong>Pre Test Functions</strong> and then PBS.<br>
The Pressure Scanner Functions window is displayed.<br>
<img src="images/PurgePanel.gif" width="404" height="344" alt=""/>  </li>
  <li>Select&nbsp;<strong>Zero&nbsp;</strong>from the Pressure Scanner Functions window.<br>
    A dialogue box is displayed, indicating all configured scanners are being zeroed.<br>
    <br>
    When the scanners have been zeroed, the dialogue box is closed and the operator is returned to the Pressure Scanner Functions window.</li></ol>
