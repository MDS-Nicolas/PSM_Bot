<h1>How To &ndash; Backup and Recover Data for the UECU-Mark III Throttle System<a href="#" onClick="window.print(); return false;"><img src="../../../../Images/IconPrint.png" alt="Print Icon" width="45" height="62" style="display:block; float: right; "></a></h1></div>
<p>This <strong>How To</strong> provides information on how to backup and recover data for the UECU-500 Mark III Throttle System.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p class="Note">This section is applicable to customers who purchased the UECU-500 Mark III Throttle System without an MDS proDAS installation. For customers with an MDS proDAS installation, refer to the Data Back-up and Recovery procedures in the Computer Config section of your PSM.</p>

<p class="Caution">MDS recommends reviewing the backup log files weekly to verify successful completion of the backup operation. Failing to do so could result in permanent loss of data.</p>
<p>The UECU display computer is backed up using Acronis Backup and Recovery Advanced Workstation with Universal Restore software. Acronis Backup and Recovery Advanced Workstation with Universal Restore automatically creates backup images of the display computer's hard drive. The backup images are automatically stored on an external source such as a Network Attached Storage (NAS).</p>
<p>Performing a backup, restoration or a crash recovery of data is all accomplished with Acronis Backup and Recovery Advanced Workstation with Universal Restore software. Acronis allows the user to perform the following:</p>

  <li><a href="?21#DisasterRecovery">Disaster Recovery</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As part of an effective backup strategy, it is recommended  that an Acronis Bootable Rescue Media be created for  the display computer before testing begins for the first time.</p>
<p class="Caution">It is highly recommended that an Acronis Bootable Rescue Media be created using the Acronis Backup and Recovery  Advanced Workstation with Universal Restore software before testing begins for the first time. The Acronis Bootable Rescue Media is an integral part of the recovery process. Failure to create an Acronis Bootable Rescue Media could result in permanent loss of data.</p>

<p>For further information on creating an Acronis Bootable Rescue Media , see the <a href="../../../../ControlMonitor/UECU/UECUVDocs.html">Acronis  Backup and Recovery Advanced Workstation with Universal Restore User Guide</a>.</p>
<p class="Note">Acronis  Backup and Recovery  Advanced Workstation with Universal Restore  is very powerful software for data backup and recovery. It has many useful functions that are not covered by this manual. For more information,  see the <a href="../../../../ControlMonitor/UECU/UECUVDocs.html">Acronis  Backup and Recovery Advanced Workstation with Universal Restore User Guide</a>. </p>
