<p>This <strong>How To</strong> provides the steps required to troubleshoot issues with a resolver.</p>
<p> One of the difficulties with troubleshooting resolver problems is that there is no easy access to the data the electronic engine control (EEC) is receiving.  If the two resolver channels (A vs. B) differ by too great of a margin, the EEC outputs an error on the ARINC bus and stops updating the data. </p>
<p>If the EEC outputs an error check for incorrect excitation wiring.</p>
<h2>To Check for Incorrect Excitation Wiring:</h2>
<ol>
<li> Confirm that the excitation voltage is being properly sent to the digital to resolver converters.  The excitation voltage can be measured on the terminals on the digital to resolver converters inside the resolver chassis. </li>
</ol>
<p class="Note">Even though the voltage may appear fine on the voltmeter, if the excitation + and &ndash; are reversed the sin and cos signals will be out of phase and the EEC will still give an error.  Under normal operation, the sin signal leads the cos signal by 90 Deg.  This can be confirmed using an oscilloscope.  If both signals are out of phase, a commanded angle of 40 Deg which should have produced voltages of 2.25 and 2.68 Vrms respectively,  instead produces a voltage of -2.25 and -2.68 Vrms.  This is equivalent to a commanded angle of -140 Deg.</p>
<p class="Note">This error can not be detected simply by calculating the expected Vsin and Vcos for a given angle.  Since the AC voltages won&rsquo;t show up as negative values on a voltmeter, the easiest way to troubleshoot this problem is to simply swap the + and &ndash; of the excitation going to one of the resolver converters.  This should put the two signals back in phase and the EEC should recognize the angle.  It may not be the angle commanded. </p>
