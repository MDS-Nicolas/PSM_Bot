<p>This <strong>How To</strong> provides the steps required to scan and verify the computer's hard drive. You can solve some computer problems by checking a drive or drives for errors. For example, you can check your computer's primary hard disk to fix some performance issues, or you can check an external hard drive if it is not working properly.<br>
</p>
<h2>To Scan the Hard Drive for Errors</h2>

<p class="Caution">Electrostatic discharge can damage components and/or boards on your computer system. To avoid damage from electrostatic discharge when handling components and/or boards, wear an electrostatic strap that is connected to a proper ground.</p>
<p class="Note">Scanning the hard drive for errors may take several minutes to several hours, depending on the size of the hard drive.</p>
<ol>  
  <li>Stop or close all applications that are running on your computer.</li>
  <li>Select <strong>Start</strong>, <strong>Computer</strong> to display the installed Hard Disk Drives.</li>
  <li>Right-click the <strong>drive</strong> that you want to scan, and then click <strong>Properties</strong>.</li>
  <li>Click the <strong>Tools</strong> tab, and then, under <strong>Error-checking</strong>, click <strong>Check now</strong>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</li>
  <li>There are two <em>Check disk</em> options. You can select one or both options as required:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>  To automatically repair problems with files and folders that the scan detects, select <strong>Automatically fix file system errors</strong>. If this is not selected,  the disk check will report problems but not fix them.</li>
      <li> To perform a thorough check, select <strong>Scan for and attempt recovery of bad sectors</strong>. This scan attempts to find and repair physical errors on the drive itself, but can take much longer to complete the process.</li>
      <li> To check for <strong>both</strong> <em>file errors</em> and <em>physical errors</em>, select<em> </em><strong>Automatically fix file system errors</strong> and <strong>Scan for and attempt recovery of bad sectors.</strong></li></ul>
  <li>Click <strong>Start</strong>.</li>
  <p class="Note">Depending on the size of your drive, this process might take several minutes. For best results, don't use your computer for any other tasks while it is checking for errors.</p>
  <p class="Note"> If you select &quot;Automatically fix file system errors&quot; for a drive that is in use (for example, the partition that contains Windows), you will be prompted to reschedule the check for the next time you restart your computer.</p>
 
</ol>
<p class="Caution">Replace the hard drive if errors are detected by the disk scanning tool after repeated scans.</p>
