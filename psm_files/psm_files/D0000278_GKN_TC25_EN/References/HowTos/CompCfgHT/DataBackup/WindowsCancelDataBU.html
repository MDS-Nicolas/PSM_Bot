<p>This <strong>How To</strong> provides the steps required to cancel the data backup process on a Windows based computer.</p>
<p>Acronis Backup and Recovery Advanced Workstation with Universal Restore software is set up to create backup images of the local hard drive. The backup images are stored on a <a href="#NAS">NAS</a>.</p>
<p>The automatic backup tasks do not verify if proDAS is scanning before they begin. If testing is performed outside of regular work hours or on weekends, a backup may occur while proDAS is scanning. To ensure performance is not affected, the backup can be manually cancelled.</p>
<p class="Note">MDS does not recommend cancelling scheduled full or incremental backups because these processes have been staggered on a per computer basis and are expected to be completed quickly. Incremental backups are smaller and processed rapidly and are not expected to have any serious impact on computer performance.</p>
<p class="Caution">To prevent serious damage to the hard drive, do not perform a hard reset or turn the power off during a backup. If required, you can shut down or restart the computer using the Start menu only.</p>
<p class="Note">A backup can only be cancelled when the user is logged in as an Administrator.</p>
