<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This section contains general facility health and safety cautions and warnings for the prevention of injury and/or damage to equipment. For system specific cautions and warnings, see the applicable sections in this Product Support Manual (PSM).</p>
<h2 id="EnergyIsolation">Energy Isolation-Lockout/Tag out (EI-LO/TO) Safety</h2>
<p class="Warning">To prevent serious injury and or irreparable damage to equipment, MDS advises that  an Energy Isolation-Lockout/Tag out (EI-LO/TO) safety program is  followed for all equipment where maintenance is required that could result in worker injury or equipment damage. </p>
<p>The program/procedures must adopt the regulatory Health &amp; Safety requirements for your  jurisdiction and company as well as the manufacturer recommendations. </p>
<p>Modern machinery  can contain many hazards from electrical, mechanical, pneumatic, or  hydraulic energy sources. Disconnecting or making the equipment safe to work on  involves the removal of all energy sources. This is known as energy isolation<em>.</em></p>
<p>Lockout/Tag out refers to the safety procedure used in industry  to ensure that dangerous machines have been properly shut down and are  incapable of being started up again prior to the completion of maintenance or  servicing work. Energy isolation requires that all hazardous energy sources have been (1) identified (2) isolated and (3) rendered inoperative to  prevent the release of potentially hazardous energy prior to the start of any repair or  maintenance procedure. This is accomplished through the locking and tagging of all energy sources. </p>
<p>Some common forms  of energy isolation include:</p>
<ul>
  <li> electrical circuit breakers</li>
  <li> disconnect switches</li>
  <li>ball or gate valves</li>
  <li>blind flanges</li>
  <li>blocks</li>
</ul>
<p class="Note">Push buttons,  e-stops, selector switches and control panels are not considered proper points  for energy isolation.<br>
