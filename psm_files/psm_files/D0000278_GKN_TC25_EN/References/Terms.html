  <tr> 
    <td width="20%">Channel    </td>
    <td width="75%">A channel is the basic structure for collecting, storing 
        and processing data. Normally, it consists of an instrumentation signal 
        source (e.g. transducer), a storage location in the <span style="color: #000000;  font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; text-transform: none; vertical-align: baseline">current 
        value table</span> (CVT) for the data, and all of the hardware (cables, 
        signal conditioners, converters...) and associated software between them.<br>
        <br>Channels can be used to transmit data to other systems. 
        In this case, the channel signal source is the CVT, and the final destination 
        is a storage location in the receiving system.<br>
<br>Channels can be used to provide communications between 
        the RTE, other systems such as a Facility Control System or a Engine Management 
    System.    </td>

        Each channel has a unique channel definition.<br>

  <tr> 
    <td width="20%">Critical Channel    </td>
    <td width="75%">A critical channel contains data that is extremely 
        important to the test, or which has safety implications. Any channel may 
        be defined as a critical channel.      <br>
        <br>Data from critical channels is continuously recorded

        channels</span> in a revolving (first-in, first out) buffer.  At any time the 
        operator can save the log, and the data in the buffer will be transferred to permanent 
        storage.      <br>
        <br>The log can be set to save data from before and after 
        an event. For example, a log could save the three minutes of data before 
        the save command is issued, and the next two minutes of data after the 
        save command. This allows analysis of data before and after a particular 
    event or problem.    </td>

      <br>The CVT stores these values and displays them on the
