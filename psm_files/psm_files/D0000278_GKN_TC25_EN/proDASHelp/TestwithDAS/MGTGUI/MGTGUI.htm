<h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The Management GUI is the main interface between the user and the proDAS system, providing a user-friendly interface to control all aspects of the testing process. From the Management GUI, the Real-Time Engine (RTE) can be configured in either acquisition mode or replay mode. The Management GUI also controls access to all other components of proDAS, such as the configuration and calibration tools.</p>
<p class="Note">The Management GUI automatically resets to acquisition mode when it is closed while in replay mode or when proDAS restarts.</p>
<p>When started, the Management GUI connects to the RTE. Anytime a connection to the RTE is established, a configurable start-up script is launched. This script starts the Unified Event Log (UEL) Display. The Management GUI Control Panel is also displayed. It is from this panel that the user is able to configure proDAS.</p>
<p>When the user first logs into the system, prior to the configuration of the RTE, the Management GUI allows the user to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>configure proDAS</li>
  <li>edit the configuration data</li>
  <li>edit the User Administration settings</li>
  <li>exit proDAS</li>
  <li>run post processing software</li>
</ul>
<p>When the RTE is configured but not scanning, the Management GUI allows the user to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>edit the configuration data</li>
  <li>start the RTE Scanning</li>
  <li>run post processing software</li>
  <li>edit the User Administration settings</li>
  <li>exit proDAS</li>
</ul>
<p class="Note">The RTE will not fully initialise if there is less than the defined amount of disk space available (the defined amount is 250 MB). If less than 250 MB of space is available when the RTE is initialised, a UEL warning message is displayed and the RTE does not fully initialise. The system also checks every five minutes (default) whether there is enough disc space. If there is not, a warning is displayed in the UEL. This automatic checking feature can be disabled in the proDAS initialisation file.</p>
<p>After the RTE is scanning, the Management GUI  allows the user to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>edit the configuration data</li>
  <li>open the Test Page
  </li><li>run post processing software</li>
  <li>run other proDAS Tools and Utilities</li>
  <li>run pre-run checks and calibration functions</li>
  <li>stop the RTE from scanning</li>
  <li>edit the User Administration settings</li>
  <li>access the Test Information Page</li>
  <li>exit proDAS  </li>
</ul>
<p class="Note">The RTE can support a maximum of 50 hardware subsystems and a total of 64 subsystems.</p>

<p>When selecting a configuration, if there is only one option the Management GUI will default to this option. It is only after all drop-down fields contain a valid entry that the configuration is applied to the RTE. </p>
<p>When the user selects Apply, the Management GUI  sets the selected configuration as the Current Configuration. When this occurs a consistency check is done on the configuration. This consistency check performs checks such as ensuring channel and hardware definitions match what is listed in the Subsystem Editor. If the configuration fails the consistency check, the Management GUI notifies the user that the configuration is inconsistent. If the configuration is successfully made Current, and if the test name selected was a new test, a dialogue box is displayed prompting for the test name, the engine serial number and the engine build number.</p>
<p class="Note">If the test name entered is not unique, it is rejected by the <a href="../../StandardTools/TRSCDB/TRSCDB.htm">Test Results and Sensor Calibration Database (TRSCDB)</a>.</p>
<p>In the case of a new test, the engine serial number, engine build number and test name is written to the database prior to sending the configuration command. After the selected configuration is set as Current and the Test Header table data has been updated, the Management GUI sends the command to configure the RTE.</p>
<p>The Management GUI displays a  Test Information Page to the user while the RTE is configuring.</p>
<p class="Note">If a customer specific Test Information Page is not available, the default Test Information Page is displayed.</p>
<p>This happens regardless of whether the test is a new test or an existing test. Once the RTE is successfully configured the Management GUI  sets the configuration as the Default Configuration and starts the RTE scanning. If in replay mode, the Management GUI  starts the Replay Control GUI.</p>

<p>For more information, see <a href="../../StandardTools/SetupDataRecording/SetupDataRecording.htm">Transient Logs</a> in Setup Data Recording. </p>
<h4 id="CriticalLog">Critical Log</h4>
<p>The critical log is a rotating log which is started automatically when Start Scan is selected on the Management GUI Control Panel. The critical log records data continuously from all of the channels defined as critical in the current configuration.</p>
<p>The critical log records a rotating data buffer in seconds. The length of the buffer is determined by adding the <strong>crit_pre-event</strong> and the <strong>crit_post_event values</strong>, where:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>crit_pre_event </strong>is the maximum length of time that data is recorded before the critical event which triggers the log to be saved. The value for <strong>crit_pre_event </strong>(in seconds) is defined in the RTE initialisation file</li>
  <li><strong>crit_post_event </strong>is the length of time that data is recorded after the critical event which triggers the log to be saved. The value for <strong>crit_post_event </strong>(in seconds) is defined in the RTE initialisation file</li>
</ul>
<p>If proDAS has been monitoring an engine test for less than the <strong>crit_pre_event </strong>seconds, then only the number of seconds recorded since the start of scanning plus <strong>crit_post_event </strong>seconds will be saved in the critical log.</p>
<p class="Note">Maximum total time in seconds of a critical log is 300 seconds (5 minutes).</p>
<p>A critical log can be saved whenever a record of the activity on all the critical channels is required. When the critical log is saved by the user, the buffered data is saved to the critical log file.</p>
<p class="Note">For detailed information on configuring a critical channel, see the <a 
href="../../DASSubSysConfig/ChannelEditor/ChannelEditor.htm">Channel Editor</a>.</p>
<p>Critical logs can be saved:</p>
<ul>
  <li>by selecting the <strong>Save Critical Log</strong> button on the Test Page displayed on the Management Interface Computer</li>
  <li>automatically as an action to an alarm or warning. The alarm conditions and the actions associated with each limit are specified in the individual channel's configuration (for detailed information on adding an action to an alarm, see the <a 
href="../../DASSubSysConfig/ChannelEditor/ChannelEditor.htm">Channel Editor</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>The log is saved to the hard disk, of the Host Computer, in the file:</p>
<p class="Indented1">/users/RTE/logs/&lt;<em><strong>enginename</strong></em>&gt;&lt;<em><strong>testname</strong></em>&gt;/hist_logs/cr<em><strong>YYMMDDHHmmss</strong></em></p>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>enginename is the name of the engine tested </li>
  <li>testname is the name of the test on the Test Information Page</li>
  <li>cr identifies the file as a critical log </li>
  <li>YYMMDD is the current year, month, and day </li>
  <li>HHmmss is the hour (0-23), minute, and second at which the log was saved</li>
</ul>
<p>When a critical log has been saved a message will be written to the UEL.</p>
<h3 id="Fullset">Fullset Panel</h3>
<p>A fullset is a scan of all channels averaged over a given period of time. The Fullset Panel allows the user to determine the duration, associated comments, and test step for a given fullset.

<h4 id="Manoeuvre">Manoeuvre</h4>
<p>A manoeuvre is defined as a single recording, of specified duration, of dynamic data. During a test, the system operator can opt to record chunks of data (i.e.: manoeuvres) rather than record all of the data. For example, during a two hour period, six separate, eight minute manoeuvres could be recorded and saved to disk or two consecutive manoeuvres could be recorded and saved to disk. Manoeuvres are available for manual post-processing immediately after writing to disk. Manoeuvres are processed automatically, if the system is configured for on-line analysis, immediately after writing to disk.</p>
<p>The system operator can specify the Elapsed Time of an unscheduled manoeuvre (i.e.: in minutes) by entering the time in the Elapsed Time field. The time, in minutes, can be incremented or decremented by using the up and down arrows at the right of the Elapsed Time field. The manoeuvre stops automatically, when the available time is reached, and the system switches to the <strong>Monitor</strong> mode from the <strong>Recording</strong> mode. When monitoring resumes, a new background file is created.</p>
<p>The analyst can perform post-processing on the data either during the test or immediately after the test as the manoeuvre data is accessible immediately after the recording of the manoeuvre has been completed  and for a set time after the test (until the data has been archived). Post-processing can be carried out on a separate PC at the same time the system is monitoring and recording new data.</p>
<p class="Note">Archived and restored tests cannot be resumed.</p>
<h4 id="SaveSentry">Save Sentry</h4>
<p class="Note">The Save Critical Log function shall trigger the saving of the DDS Sentry.</p>
<p> From the  Test Page, selecting the <strong>Save Critical Log/Save Sentry</strong> button starts the save sentry operation. This results in the collection of the background files from all pertinent disk sets as well as the disk set switching. Confirmation of the <strong>Save Sentry</strong> is displayed in the Test Diary window.</p>

<p>The Test Diary Window is used to record the test history information including all data recordings, operator comments and the test header information. The Test Page screen contains a Test Diary tab which lists the most recent 200 Test Diary entries. The entries are listed in chronological order, with the most recent events at the bottom of the list. The Test DiaryWindow refreshes each time the Management GUI writes data to the Test Diary. A Pause button above the Test Diary Window, when selected, pauses the updating of the Test Diary Window enabling the operator to scroll back to review earlier entries. Selecting the Play button, above the Test Diary Window, refreshes the Test Diary Window.</p>
<p>The Management GUI checks to determine if the Test Diary Window needs to be refreshed with the latest database entries every 10 seconds. The Management GUI records the following events to the Test Diary:</p>
<ul>
  <li>fullset recorded, with Scan Identifier, Comment, and Extract Id, whether started manually from the Management GUI or via a Test Procedure</li>
  <li>HAMS fullset recorded, with Comment and Extract Id</li>
