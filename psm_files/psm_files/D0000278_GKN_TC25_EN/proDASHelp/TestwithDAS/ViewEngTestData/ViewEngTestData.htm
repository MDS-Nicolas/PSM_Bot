<h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>
<p>proDAS enables engine test data to be displayed, printed, and played back through the use of the Reporting and Viewing Environment (RAVE) 
  application, the Time On Condition and Engine Usage Monitoring (TOCEUM) Subsystem interface, and the Replay Mode. The RAVE and 
  TOCEUM applications can be accessed from the proDAS Management GUI Control Panel. 
  The Replay Control GUI is launched automatically from the Management GUI Control Panel when proDAS is configured in  Replay Mode.</p>
<h2 id="RAVE">Reporting and Viewing Environment Application (RAVE)</h2>
<p>The Reporting and Viewing Environment (RAVE) is an application used to view data recorded during a test and to create reports.</p>
<p>The engine test data, collected by proDAS, consists of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>fullsets and event comments (saved in the proDAS database)</li>
  <li>Critical, Transient, and Continuous Logs (stored in the log directories on the Host Computer)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Critical, Transient, and Continuous logs require conversion from binary to ASCII text for report viewing, analysis or printing purposes.</p>
<p>The RAVE application consists of three main screens:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the Test Selection screen</li>
  <li>the Reports screen</li>
  <li>the Data screen</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="TestSelectScrn">Test Selection Screen</h3>
<p>The Test Selection screen (displayed below) is launched after login. The user can retrieve any combination of engine tests using the query builder tool. The range of retrieved data is refined by execution of a single query defined as a set of selected search parameters. Typically, data is retrieved by selecting <em>predefined</em> (already saved) queries from a drop-down list. A query cannot locate a historical test or group of tests that have been archived.</p>
