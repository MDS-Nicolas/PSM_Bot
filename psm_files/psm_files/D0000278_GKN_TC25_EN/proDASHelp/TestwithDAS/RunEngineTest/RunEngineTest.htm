<h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>
<p>This module is designed to be used as a reference guide in the everyday work of the test cell operator. The different operator functions that can be performed while proDAS is scanning and acquiring data are explained through step-by-step procedures.</p>
<p>Before an engine test can be started and data acquired, there are several set up tasks that may be required to be performed. The following is a list of preparation tasks that might apply and the associated sections that describe the desired task:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Performing Calibrations - see <a href="../../StandardTools/CalibrateChannels/CalibrateChannels.htm#SCA" >Sensor Calibration Application (SCA)</a> and <a href="../../DASConfigTools/SensorEditor/SensorEditor.htm">Sensor Editor</a> for details on how to perform calibrations on VXI channels</li>
  <li>Performing Thrust Calibration - see Thrust Calibration</li>
  <li> Setting up Data Recording - see <a href="../../StandardTools/SetupDataRecording/SetupDataRecording.htm" >Setup Data Recording</a> for details on how to set up data recording functions such as transient logs</li>
  <li> Setting up Test Procedure Scripts - see <a href="../../DASConfigTools/ScriptEditor/ScriptEditor.htm" >Script Editor</a></li>
  <li> Creating Operator Display Pages - see <a href="../../DASConfigTools/DisplayPages/DisplayPages.htm" >Creating and Modifying Display Pages</a></li>
</ul>
<p>After all the appropriate tasks have been completed proDAS must be configured with a master configuration. The operators are required to enter test information including test name, engine serial number, and the operator&rsquo;s names into the Test Information Page. Please see <a href="../StartConfigStopDAS/StartConfigStopDAS.htm">Starting, Configuring and Stopping proDAS</a> for more information on the configuration process. </p>
<p>proDAS gives the operator the ability to run various pre-run checks prior to acquiring data. These tests may allow the user to perform functions such as confirming channel readings are within the appropriate ranges, and zeroing temperature and pressure channels.</p>
<p>The execution of the pre-run checks depends on Customer hardware and procedures. For details on the pre-run checks, see <a href="../../CustomApps/InstrumentControls/InstrumentControls.htm#InstrumentControls">Instrument Controls</a>.</p>

 <p class="Note">Please refer to the &quot;Home&quot; section of the Docstation for details on your applicable pre-run checks.</p>
<p>proDAS provides several user configurable displays that can be used to view the current data during an engine test, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#RTDDriver">Real-Time Display (RTD) Driver</a></li>
  <li><a href="#UsingSpotlight">Spotlights</a></li>
  <li><a href="../../CustomApps/ArincChanList/ArincChanList.htm">ARINC Display (available only if ARINC is configured)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>proDAS performs logging of all system event messages, including operator interactions, alarm conditions, warning messages, and error messages using the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#UnifiedEventLog">Unified Event Log (UEL)</a></li>
  <li>Alarm Summary Display (see <a href="#InterpretAlarmsWarnings2">Interpreting Alarms and Monitoring</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>During an engine test, most of the testing tasks can be performed using the Test Page. Please see <a href="#OpenTestEngPage">Opening the Test Page</a> for further details.</p>
<p>proDAS has the ability to run predefined engine test procedure scripts that instruct the operators on how to test the engine as well as automatically record data such as fullsets or logs. Please see <a href="#SelectRunTestProcedure">Selecting and Running a Test Procedure</a> for further details. </p>
<p>If required, the operators may also record test data independent of an engine test script. proDAS can record the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#RecordHistoryLogs">Transient Logs</a></li>
  <li><a href="#RecordFullset">Fullsets</a></li>
  <li><a href="#RecordCriticalLog">Critical Logs</a></li>
  <li><a href="#ContinuousLog">Continuous Logs (if configured)</a></li>
  <li><a href="#InsertOpComments">Test Comments</a></li>
  <li><a href="../../DASSubSysConfig/HighSpeedVXI/HighSpeedVXI.htm">High Speed Logs (if HSV hardware is available)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>During an engine test the operator has the ability to modify the following channel parameters:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#UseChanRedirect">Set/Redirect Channel Value</a></li>
  <li><a href="#SettingChannelQuality">Set Channel Quality</a></li>
  <li><a href="#ModChanLimitsWhileproDASScans">Set Channel Limit</a></li>
</ul>
<p>proDAS gives the operator access to several reports that may be useful during an engine test. These reports are accessed through the <a href="#RTReports">Real Time (RT) Reports GUI</a>.</p>
<p>proDAS has a built in Timer that operators can use during the engine test. Please see <a href="#UsingStopWatchFeature">Using the Timer Feature</a> for further details.</p>

<h2 id="SelectRTDisplay">Selecting a Real-Time Display</h2>
<p>The Real-Time Display System is used for viewing engine data in real-time. It consists of the Real-Time Display Editor and Real-Time Display Driver.</p>
<p>For more information on the Real-Time Display Editor, see <a href="../../DASConfigTools/DisplayPages/DisplayPages.htm" >Real-Time Display Editor in Creating and Modifying Display Pages</a>.</p>
<h3 id="RTDDriver">Real-Time Display Driver</h3>
<p>The Real-Time Display Driver (RTD Driver) displays information during the execution of a test run and allows the user to control test bed and test objects (an engine or component such as a compressor). It displays pre-configured display pages and Spotlight Sticky's.</p>
<p class="Note">The user can execute multiple instances of the Real-Time Display Driver on the same computer at the same time. This is particularly useful if multiple views or multiple monitors are used on the same PC.</p>
<p class="Note">When the RTD Driver is closed the Spotlight Sticky definitions are saved to file and the existing Spotlight Sticky definition files are deleted. When the RTD Driver is re-opened the most recent Spotlight Sticky's are automatically loaded.</p>
<p class="Caution">Performance can be impacted if too many displays are selected.</p>
<p>The RTD Driver comprises the <a href="?33#PageView">View Test Page</a> window, the <a href="?34#ControlView">Control View</a> and the <a href="?35#AutoInterface">Automation Interface.</a></p>
<p>For detailed information on the COM interface(s), refer to <a href="../../References/ICDs/ICD2822RTDPS.PDF"> ICD78026.2822 Real-Time Data Proxy Server</a>.</p>
<h4 id="RTDD-Security">Security Levels</h4>
<p>The RTD Driver can operate in either Read Only or Write mode, depending on the security level of the user. Security levels are defined through the <a href="../../StandardTools/USS/USS.htm">User Security System</a>.</p>

By default (i.e.: if nothing is entered by the user in the respective input field), this string contains all the information specific to the currently used configuration (i.e.: engine type, engine standard, built, customer, etc.). In addition, the shape and colour of the marker symbols, indicating the fullset data points on the diagrams, may be specified. </li>
  <p class="Note">The colour selected for these marker symbols is applied to both the RTD Y/X and Profile Plot Controls, their shape is only applied in case of RTD Profile Plot Controls. In RTD Y/X Plot Controls, the shape of the marker symbols for the overlaid fullset data is adopted from the corresponding online data points.</p>
  <li>In order to access fullsets available in the database, several items displayed in the tree control list on the left hand side of the dialogue have to be unfolded by clicking on them.</li>
  <li>Mark a specific test (lowest level of the configuration tree) to display all fullsets taken during this run in the Selection Options spreadsheet to the right of the tree control.<br>
    This list of displayed fullsets may be filtered by certain criteria which can be specified or modified by selecting the <img alt="Define Filter" src="images/DefineFilter.png"> button on the <strong>Selection Options</strong> toolbar. In this filter settings dialogue, not only can certain value ranges for specific channels be defined but also the conjunctions and disjunctions of pairs of those value ranges.<br>
    After the changes made in the filter settings dialogue have been applied by closing it again, the filter criteria may be applied to the list of selected fullsets by selecting the <img alt="Apply Filter" src="images/ApplyFilter.png"> button on the <strong>Selection Options</strong> toolbar. Then, only those fullsets for which the filter criteria are fulfilled are displayed in the list.<br>
    Clicking on the <img alt="" src="images/SelectAllFullsets.png"> button selects all fullsets currently displayed in the list. Specific fullsets may also be selected or deselected by clicking in the corresponding check boxes in the fullset list. The <img alt="" src="images/DeselectAllFullsets.png" > button deselects all fullsets in the list, while the <img alt="" src="images/InvertSelectedFullsets.png" > button inverts the selected and deselected fullsets.
    <p class="Note">Since not only fullsets from a single test run can be added to a subset, this selection procedure may be repeated for one or more other tests after each of them has been selected in the tree control.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Use the radio button group <strong>Apply settings</strong> to specify whether the modifications made in the fullset selection dialogue are to be applied only to the current page view (only applicable, if the fullset selection dialogue has been called via the menu of a page view), to all views of this instance of the RTD Driver, or to all views of all RTD Drivers on the various computers of this proDAS installation.
    <div class="Container"><img src="images/ApplySettings.png" alt="Apply Settings" width="240" height="93"></div>
  </li>
  <li> To delete a specific fullset group, mark the fullset group in the respective spreadsheet and select the <strong>Delete Group</strong> button. </li>
</ol>
<p class="Note">All modifications made in the fullset selection dialogue are applied only when the OK button is finally pressed and, as a result, the dialogue is closed. Pressing the Cancel button closes the dialogue and disregards all changes since the dialogue has been opened.</p>
<p class="Note">When a new group is created, the active column of the new group must be clicked twice to select or deselect it in the list.</p>

<h2 id="UsingSpotlight">Using the Spotlight Feature</h2>
<p>Spotlight Sticky's are small windows created during an engine test which display current values for some channels. They are useful for troubleshooting or monitoring a channel not appearing on one of the currently selected Real-Time Displays.</p>
<p class="Note">When the RTD Driver is closed the Spotlight Sticky's are saved to file. When the RTD Driver is re-opened the Spotlight Sticky's are automatically loaded.</p>
<p class="Note">When setting channel values through spotlight sticky's, a warning message appears in the UEL if the value is not appropriate for the channel. If the value is appropriate, a message appears in the UEL showing the update is successful.</p>
<h3 id="CreateSpotlightSticky">Creating Spotlight Sticky Windows</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Select <strong>Tools - Create Spotlight</strong> or the <img alt="" src="images/ButtonSpotlightSticky.PNG" > button on the <a href="?62#ControlView">RT Display Driver Control View</a>.<br>
    The Create Spotlight Window is displayed.
    <div class="Container"><img src="images/SpotlightStickyCreateDialog.PNG" alt="Spotlight Sticky Create Dialog" width="467" height="439"></div>
    The list on the left contains the names of the available channels in alphabetical order. Entering characters in the <strong>Filter</strong> field above the list provokes a filtration of the list depending on the input.</li>
  <li>Select the channels either by double-clicking them or using the buttons <strong>Add = &gt;</strong> / <strong>&lt;= Remove</strong> respectively. Up to 10 channels are possible.<br>
    If the channel is a setable channel (a calculated channel with a constant equation and an Acquisition Rate = n) and the check box <strong>Enable Input</strong> is clicked, the Spotlight Sticky is displayed as an input control. Otherwise a value control is displayed.</li>
  <p class="Note">The Set EU button enables the operator to select another appropriate Engineering Unit (EU) for displaying the value of a channel. The RTD Driver converts the values of this channel automatically.</p>
  <li>Push <strong>Create</strong> to create the Spotlight Sticky.

<h2 id="UnifiedEventLog">Unified Event Log (UEL)</h2>
<p>The Unified Event Log (UEL) is responsible for tracking all events that occur while proDAS is running. All messages from the Real-Time Engine are displayed in the UEL Display window, along with filter masks, are stored in a single event log file. Text messages are written to the UEL whenever an event occurs (e.g.: starting test monitoring, taking a fullset, or registering an alarm).</p>
<p>A new event log is created and started whenever proDAS is reconfigured.</p>
<p>Event logs are saved to the hard disk, of the Host Computer, in the file:</p>
<p class="Indented1">/users/RTE/logs/<strong><em>enginename</em></strong>/<em><strong>testname</strong></em>/event_logs/el<strong><em>YYMMDDHHmmss</em></strong></p>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>enginename is the name of the test engine</li>
  <li>testname is the name of the test record</li>
  <li>el identifies the file as an event log</li>
  <li>YYMMDD is the year, month, and day on which the log was opened</li>
  <li>HHmmss is the hour (0-23), minute, and second at which the log was opened</li>
</ul>
<p>The events displayed on the event log are stored in a text file. The event log can be stopped at any time, and all statements will be saved to the text file.</p>
<p class="Note">The messages written in the text file support non-English characters.</p>
<h3 id="EventHandlerWindow">Unified Event Log Display</h3>
<p>The messages stored in the event log are displayed in the UEL display. proDAS may open several UEL displays that contain filters that determine the events that appear in the window. New messages always cause the UEL display to scroll down to the last entry in the event log.</p>

<h2 id="InterpretAlarmsWarnings2">Interpreting Alarms and Warnings</h2>
<p>During an engine test, an operator will be notified, by an Alarm or Warning, when the value of a monitored channel is beyond the safe operating threshold. The operating threshold is determined by the limit value assigned to the channel(s) in the configuration. proDAS indicates the channel that caused the alarm or warning, the initiating subsystem, and the type of alarm in the <a href="?68#AlarmSummaryWindow">Alarm Summary Display Window</a>. A warning or an alarm can trigger a subsequent predefined action, such as changing the value of a discrete channel, recording a fullset, or starting a transient log.</p>
<p>For detailed information on defining alarm conditions in the test configuration, see the <a href="../../DASSubSysConfig/ChannelEditor/ChannelEditor.htm">Channel Editor</a>.</p>
<p>Warnings indicate when a channel is exceeding its defined normal operating range. Warnings do not trigger an audible alarm and may or may not require acknowledgment by the operator. A warning is indicated by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>displaying a message in yellow in the Event Handler window and in the Alarm Summary window</li>
  <li>recording the warning message in the Unified Event Log (UEL)</li>
  <li>by changing the operator page objects that represents the channel change to yellow</li>
</ul>
<p>Alarms indicate when a channel has surpassed its defined extreme value and operator intervention is required to correct the problem.</p>
<p>An alarm is indicated by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>displaying a message in red in the Unified Event Log window indicating subsystem name, channel name and alarm type (HIHI, LOLO or DISCALARM)</li>
  <li>displaying the channel in the Alarm Summary window with its limit value and current recorded value</li>
  <li>a message recorded in the Unified Event Log</li>
  <li>the colour of any display object showing that channel will change to red</li>
  <li>an immediate audible alarm (buzzer) is sounded (if so equipped)</li>
</ul>
<p>All alarms must be acknowledged by the user. If the audible alarm is triggered by more than one alarm, then each alarm must be acknowledged. However, the audible alarm is turned off after the first acknowledgment.</p>
<p>Warning and alarm types that are processed by proDAS are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>high alarm (HIHI) - red</li>
  <li>high warning (HI) - yellow</li>
  <li>low warning (LO) - yellow</li>
  <li>low alarm (LOLO) - red</li>
  <li> rate of change (ROC) - yellow</li>
  <li>blue discrete info message (DISCINFO)</li>
  <li>red discrete alarm (DISCALARM)</li>
  <li>invisible discrete alarm (DISQUIET) provides no audible or visible signal that the limit has been violated</li>
</ul>
<p>A channel that has one or more sliding limits can have limits that contradict each other. For example, if channel B has a LO limit defined by channel C as well as a fixed HI limit of 150, it is possible for the LO limit to be greater than the HI limit. These contradictions are resolved according to the following rules of precedence:</p>
<ul>
  <li>LO limits can be overridden by any other limit</li>
  <li>HI limits can be overridden by LOLO or HIHI limits</li>
  <li>LOLO limits can be overridden by HIHI limits</li>
  <li>HIHI limits can never be overridden</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="AlarmSummaryWindow">Alarms Summary Display Window</h3>
<p>The Alarm Summary Display window provides a list of the proDAS channels as the channels transition from normal to warning and alarm states. The Alarm Summary Display window can be moved and resized by dragging the window borders.</p>
<p>The Alarm Summary Display window is displayed when Start Scan is selected on the Management GUI Control Panel.</p>
<div class="Container"><img height="225" src="images/AlarmSummaryDisplay.png" alt="Alarm Summary Display" width="700" ></div>
<p>The Alarm Summary Display window:</p>
<ul>
  <li>displays a list of proDAS channels in alarm and warning states, including limit values, current values, minimum or maximum value reached while in alarm, and the maximum deviation beyond the limit state </li>
  <li>displays channels in an alarm state (HIHI, LOLO, or DISCALARM) in black characters on a red background and displays red characters on a black background when the alarm is acknowledged</li>
  <li>displays channels in the warning state (HI or LO) in yellow characters on a black background when unacknowledged and displays black characters on a yellow background when acknowledged or if proDAS is configured so as to not require the acknowledgment of warnings</li>
  <li>displays an ordered list from newest to oldest, with channels in an alarm state followed by channels in a warning state </li>
  <li>inserts new alarms at the top of the list</li>
  <li>inserts new warnings at the top of the warning list (just after the oldest alarm). As new messages are added, channels below the insertion point are moved down, with any channel at the bottom of the window disappearing</li>
  <li>upon receipt of a new alarm, the display is brought to the front of all running windows </li>
  <li>displays a channel in the Alarm Summary Display window only once, regardless of how many times it transitions between alarm and warning states </li>
</ul>
<p class="Note">When idle, the Alarm Summary Display window periodically sends a heartbeat message to proDAS. If a preset number of consecutive failures is encountered, the Alarm Summary Window checks for the presence of the RTE. If the RTE is not found, the Status bar will show the RTE connection as being lost. If the RTE connection is lost, the Alarm Summary Window will remain open until it is closed by the operator or by the Management GUI.</p>
<p class="Note">During scanning, the Alarm Summary Display window periodically queries proDAS for the current channel values.

If the RTE is not found, the Status bar will show the RTE connection as being lost. If the RTE connection is lost, the Alarm Summary Window will remain open until it is closed by the operator or by the Management GUI.</p>
<p>The alarm summary is sorted by red Alarms and yellow Warnings and is then sorted chronologically within each group. The user cannot select a specific alarm or alarms from the list and cannot change the sort order of the list.</p>

<h3 id="AcknowledgeAlarm">Acknowledging an Alarm</h3>
<p>When a channel exceeds its limit value, an Alarm is generated by proDAS that must be acknowledged by the operator. Each alarm must be acknowledged, however the audible alarm will stop after the first acknowledgment.</p>
<p>proDAS indicates which channel has caused the alarm, the subsystem to which the channel belongs and the alarm level. The alarm message and any actions that occur can be used to help track down the source of the alarm so that the problem causing the alarm can be resolved.</p>
<p>Alarms are acknowledged, in the order in which they occur, from the <strong>Edit</strong> menu of the Alarm Summary Display window or by selecting the applicable icon from the Alarm Summary Display tool bar.</p>
<p>To acknowledge a specific alarm:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select <strong>Acknowledge</strong> from the <strong>Edit</strong> menu or select <img height="23" src="images/SingleIcon.png" alt="Single Icon" width="24" > from the tool bar.</li>
  <li>To acknowledge all alarms, select <strong>Acknowledge ALL</strong> from the <strong>Edit</strong> menu or select <img height="23" src="images/MultipleIcon.png" width="24" alt="Multiple Icon"> from the tool bar.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="proDASPropTestProcedLang">proDAS Proprietary Test Procedure Language</h3>
<p>An engine test procedure consists of a unicode file containing sequential step-by-step commands which are configured to reflect the test sequence as specified by the engine manufacturer. A test procedure script controls the test sequence and how the results are achieved. </p>
<p>These commands perform local functions in the Management Interface application and interact with the proDAS Real-Time Engine, on the Host Computer, using opcodes. </p>
<p>The test procedure script is created using the <a href="../../DASConfigTools/ScriptEditor/ScriptEditor.htm">Script Editor</a> and maintains a defined structure. The test procedure scripts should only be written using the proDAS Script Editor.</p>
<p class="Note">Opening the script in any application other than the Script Editor may result in hazardous side affects.</p>

<h2 id="RecordHistoryLogs">Recording Transient Logs</h2>
<p>A transient log is a record of selected channel values over a predetermined period of time. Many different transient logs can be defined, but only four can be recording data simultaneously (not including the critical log or continuous log). More than one instance of the same log can be running at one time. When multiple versions of a log are running, they can be stopped and saved individually. </p>
<p>Transient Logs can be started: </p>
<ul>
  <li>from the Logs Panel on the Test Page </li>
  <li>automatically, as alarm conditions in response to a limit violation </li>
</ul>
<p>A running transient log can be stopped at any time. When a running log is stopped, its contents are saved to a transient log file. If a transient log is not stopped manually, it runs for its defined duration, stops and is saved by proDAS. Two or more instances of the same log can run at the same time and each instance can be stopped (saved) individually.</p>
<p>Transient logs can be started and stopped automatically when an alarm occurs. Alarm conditions that start and stop transient logs are defined, for a channel, in the configuration for the current test. When a running transient log is stopped by an alarm condition, all instances of the running log are stopped, but only the first instance of the log is saved.</p>
<p>For detailed information on defining alarm conditions in the test configuration, see the <a href="../../DASSubSysConfig/ChannelEditor/ChannelEditor.htm">Channel Editor</a>.</p>
<p>For additional information on Transient Logs, see <a href="../../StandardTools/SetupDataRecording/SetupDataRecording.htm">Setup Data Recording</a>.</p>

    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<h2 id="RecordFullset">Recording a Fullset (Steady State Data)</h2>
<p>Steady-State fullsets are time averaged data from each of the channels measured by proDAS for the current test (all of the channels in the current configuration). For example, if the time duration of the steady-state fullset is one second, and the channel data is sampled at a 10 hertz scan rate, then the 10 samples taken during the fullset period will be averaged to a single value. The value will be stored in the proDAS database under the current test name as the channel value for the recorded steady-state fullset.</p>
<p>A steady-state fullset can be recorded at any time during an engine test. The operator can specify:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the time period (i.e.: 0 to 300 seconds) over which the data is averaged</li>
  <li>a Test Step to identify the fullset</li>
  <li>an additional comment</li>
</ul>
<p>For information on retrieving and reviewing fullset data, see <a href="../ViewEngTestData/ViewEngTestData.htm" >Viewing Fullsets and Events using RAVE in Viewing Engine Test Data</a>.</p>

</ol>

<h2 id="RecordCriticalLog">Recording a Critical Log</h2>
<p>The critical log is a rotating log which is started automatically when Start Scan is selected on the Management GUI Control Panel. The critical log records data continuously from all of the channels defined as critical in the current configuration.</p>
<p>For additional information, see <a href="../../StandardTools/SetupDataRecording/SetupDataRecording.htm#CriticalLogs">Critical Logs in Setup Data Recording</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Critical logs can be saved:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>by selecting <a href="?81#SaveCritLogFmTestEngScrn">Save Critical Log on the Test Page</a> displayed on the Management Interface Computer</li>
  <li>automatically as an action to an alarm or warning. The alarm conditions and the actions associated with each limit are specified in the individual channel configuration (for detailed information on adding an action to an alarm, see the <a href="../../DASSubSysConfig/ChannelEditor/ChannelEditor.htm">Channel Editor</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>The log is saved to the hard disk, of the Host Computer, in the file:</p>
<p class="Indented1">/users/RTE/logs/&lt;<strong><em>enginename</em></strong>&gt;&lt;<strong><em>testname</em></strong>&gt;/hist_logs/cr<em><strong>YYMMDDHHmmss</strong></em><strong></strong></p>
<p>where: </p>
<ul>
  <li>enginename is the name of the engine tested </li>
  <li>testname is the name of the test on the Test Information Page </li>
  <li>cr identifies the file as a critical log </li>
  <li>YYMMDD is the current year, month, and day</li>
  <li>HHmmss is the hour (0-23), minute, and second at which the log was saved</li>
</ul>
<p class="Note">If the RTE is configured to save the High Speed Log or the DDS Sentry with the Critical Log, this button will automatically save all relevant logs.</p>
<p class="Note">If the High Speed Log is in circular mode, there will be a specific button available to save the High Speed Log independently from the Critical Log. It is located under the Critical Log button.</p>
<h3 id="SaveCritLogFmTestEngScrn">Saving a Critical Log from the Test Page</h3>
<p>To save a Critical Log from the Test Page:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select <strong>Save Critical Log</strong>.<br>
    The proDAS critical log is saved and the following two messages are displayed in the Unified Event Log:
    <ul>
      <li>Recording critical log in <strong>crt_post_event</strong> seconds </li>
      <li>Critical log saved </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="ContinuousLog">Continuous Logging</h2>
<p>Continuous Logging is the implementation of a continuous recording and playback utility that automatically records  hardware channel data whenever proDAS is scanning. A trigger channel is used to control the starting and stopping of the continuous log. The name of the trigger channel is obtained from the RTE initialisation file. The RTE initialisation file can also be used to exclude specific hardware subsystems from the recorded data. For details, see <a href="../../StandardTools/SetupDataRecording/SetupDataRecording.htm#Inputs">Continuous Log Inputs</a>. </p>
<p>Up to 20 complete test logs can be written and stored by proDAS. When the number of continuous logs exceeds 20, the Real-Time Engine (RTE) will prompt the user to shutdown and archive; continue and overwrite the oldest log file or continue with the continuous log disabled.</p>
<p>A new log type is defined for the continuous log, called continuous_log, and is stored in the same format as the existing critical and transient logs in the \users\RTE\logs\continuous_log directory. A link to the log file is also found in the \users\RTE\logs\&lt;engine_name&gt;\&lt;test_name&gt;\hist_logs directory.</p>
<p>The channels to be recorded in the continuous log are assembled at configuration time from the configuration data.</p>
<p>If no trigger channel is defined when proDAS stops or starts scanning, the continuous log is automatically stopped and restarted. When restarted, proDAS attempts to append to the already existing continuous log file. When a trigger channel is defined for the continuous log, this channel controls the stopping and starting of the continuous log.</p>
<p>If proDAS is reconfigured with the same configuration and test name, the logs subsystem will verify whether the already existing continuous log file contains the same channels as the current configuration. If so, it will attempt to append the new data to the existing continuous log file. </p>
<p>If appending is not possible because of a configuration change or because the log file is already larger than the maximum log size allowed, a new continuous log will be started.</p>
<p class="Note">Changes to the following channel attributes cause a new continuous log file to be created:<br>
  <br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &bull; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  critical flag<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &bull; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  scan rate<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &bull; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  subsystem type<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &bull; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  discrete test true/false strings (discrete channels only)<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &bull; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  min and max values (float channels only)<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &bull; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  engineering unit (EU) (float channels only)<br>
  <br>
  Changes to the following test attributes cause a new continuous log file to be created: <br>
  <br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &bull; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  engine serial number<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &bull; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  build number</p>
<p>A continuous log event file is used to associate the individual continuous log files for the same test. This file records the start and stop times of each log, and an index into the respective log file for each start or stop occurrence. This information is then used when replaying the log file.</p>
<p>The continuous log obtains configuration information from the LOG_PLAYBACK section of the RTE initialisation file.</p>
<p class="Note">There are parameters within the RTE initialisation file that allow the log to continue recording until it reaches the 2 GB maximum size. When this happens, a new log is started with no time delay. These parameters allow a continuous log to not be stopped if it is below the size limit but over the time limit.</p>
<h2 id="InsertOpComments">Inserting Operator Comments</h2>
<p>The operator can add predefined event and test comments to the Unified Event Log from the Comments panel of the Test Page. This section includes 
  procedures for inserting:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Predefined Event Comments in the Unified Event Log window</li>
  <li>Predefined Test Comments in the Test Results and Sensor Calibration Database (TRSCDB) from the Test Page</li>
</ul>
<p class="Note">The comments field supports hexadecimal notation.</p>
<h3 id="InsertPredefinedEventAndTestComments">Inserting Predefined Event and Test Comments</h3>
<p>To insert predefined event and test comments or to add a comment to the Unified Event Log:</p>
<ol>
  <li>If desired, select a category from the <strong>Category Filter</strong> drop-down list.</li>
  <li>If desired, select a Test Step from the <strong>Test Step</strong> drop-down list.</li>
  <li>Select a comment from the <strong>Comment</strong> drop-down list on the Comments panel (below), to use an existing or edit a predefined Event comment. The comment is loaded into the comment box.

  <li>Select <strong>Save</strong>.<br>
    The comment is displayed in the Unified Event Log window. It may also appear in the Results Window and saved to the TRSCDB if configured.</li>
  <p class="Note">Adding a comment to the log is optional.</p>
</ol>
<h2 id="UseChanRedirect">Using the Channel Redirect Utility</h2>
<p>The Channel Redirect feature is used to map the value read from one channel to another. This is useful when a physical sensor is no longer responding, but its channel name is referenced in downstream calculations or on the Real-Time Displays. Unlike the Set Channel feature, once redirected, the target channel will continue to be updated with the value of the source channel until such a time as the mapping is broken.</p>

<h2 id="SettingChannelQuality">Setting the Quality of a Channel</h2>
<p>The channel quality specifies the reliability of that channel and can be set by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the operator from the Test Page, on the Management Interface Computer, while proDAS is running</li>
  <li>the proDAS application while proDAS is running</li>
</ul>
<p>The operator can mark the best quality value, known as the quality ceiling, that a channel may read.</p>
<p>proDAS sets the quality to GOOD (when the data is sound), SUSPECT (when the data is interpolated or is otherwise suspicious) or BAD (when the value cannot be acquired by the hardware). However, proDAS can never set a better quality than the current quality ceiling for a given channel. For example, if the operator sets the quality for channel A to SUSPECT, proDAS cannot set the quality to GOOD, even if a good value is measured. proDAS can only set the quality flag to BAD or SUSPECT for this channel. The operator can however, modify the quality and set the quality ceiling to GOOD, thus allowing proDAS to set any quality value.</p>
<p>Once the operator sets the quality of the channel, the data is recorded along with each measurement, for example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>setting the quality ceiling to BAD causes proDAS to record a data value of -99999, and set the quality flag to BAD</li>
  <li>setting the quality ceiling to SUSPECT flags to the end user that there is something suspicious about the data, and causes proDAS to record the actual data value and set the quality flag to SUSPECT</li>
  <li>setting the quality ceiling to GOOD causes proDAS to record the actual value and set the quality flag to GOOD</li>
</ul>
<p>The quality flag is recorded with the data in any transient log or fullset. To set the quality of a channel:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select <strong>Set Channels</strong> from the Test Page.<br>
    The Set Channel control panel, including the Set Quality Ceiling options, is displayed.
    <div class="Container"><img src="images/PnlSetChannel.png" width="631" height="201" alt="Panel Set Channel"></div>
  </li>
  <li>Select <img src="images/Btndots.gif" width="28" height="27" alt="Button Dots"> to display the Select a Channel window. Choose a channel from the list and click <strong>Select</strong>. The chosen channel is displayed in the Channel Value field, the value for that channel is displayed in the Value field, the quality of the channel is displayed in the Quality field and the ceiling for the channel is displayed in the Ceiling field.</li>
  <li>From the Quality Ceiling pulldown, select the quality ceiling for the channel.</li>
  <li>Select <strong>Set</strong> to set the channel.<br>
    The new value is set, and the changes are displayed in the Event Handler window and recorded in the Unified Event Log.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="ModChanLimitsWhileproDASScans">Modifying Channel Limits While proDAS is Scanning</h2>
<p>Channel limits are thresholds that determine when a warning or alarm is realized by proDAS. The channel limits are established in the engine configuration that is downloaded to proDAS.</p>
<p>For detailed information on setting limits on channel alarm conditions in the test configuration, see the <a href="../../DASSubSysConfig/ChannelEditor/ChannelEditor.htm">Channel Editor</a>.</p>
<p>This proDAS feature allows the operator to make marginal changes to the channel limits while proDAS is scanning. The changes are controlled and are kept within an allowable &plusmn; tolerance band of the original limit value. The new limit values remain valid until proDAS is reconfigured.</p>
<p>The operator can use this feature when a known channel is very close to the alarm threshold and is cycling in and out of alarm many times per minute.</p>
<p class="Note">Only an authorised user may set channel limits.</p>
<p>For details on the Set Channel Limit panel, see <a href="../MGTGUI/MGTGUI.htm#SetChannelLimits">Set Channel Limit Panel in the Management GUI</a>.</p>
<p>To change the limits of a channel:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select <strong>Set Channel Limit</strong> tab on the Test Page.<br>
    The Set Limits control panel is displayed listing only channels that have an associated limit.
    <div class="Container"><img src="images/PnlSetChannelLimit.gif" width="630" height="200" alt="Panel Set Channel Limit"></div>
  </li>
  <li>Select <img src="images/Btndots.gif" width="28" height="27" alt="Button Dots"> to display the Select a Channel window. This window is automatically filtered to display only channels with limits associated to them. Choose a channel and click <strong>Select</strong>.</li>
  <li>Select the limit from the Limit drop-down list.
    <p class="Note">Only limits defined for that channel are contained within the drop-down list.</p>
    Once selected, the Current Setting, Original Settings, Range High and Range Low fields are automatically filled in.</li>
  <li>Enter a new value between the Range High and Range Low values in the New Value field field.
    <p class="Note">Whan a valid entry is made, the Set button becomes enabled.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Click <strong>Set </strong> to apply the new limit value.<br>
    The new limit value and username are displayed in the  Unified Event Log window.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="RTReports">Real-Time Reports</h2>
<p>proDAS offers several status reports which are available during an engine run. The Real-Time Reports are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the Snapshot Report - provides the current value of every configured channel</li>
  <li>the Channel Limits Report - provides the current value of all limits defined for all configured channels</li>
  <li>the Master Channel List Report - describes the current configuration of all channels</li>
  <li>the Log Quality Summary Report (derived from RAVE) - indicates the quality of data in a specific log</li>
</ul>
<p>The Real-Time Reports are accessed from the RTReports GUI (below) which is launched when the Reports button is selected from the Management GUI Control Panel or Test Page.</p>
