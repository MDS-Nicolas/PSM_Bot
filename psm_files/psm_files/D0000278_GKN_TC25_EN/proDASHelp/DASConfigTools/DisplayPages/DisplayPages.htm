</a><div float:right></div></h1></div>

<h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Display pages are created, administrated and modified by the RTD Editor and displayed in the <a href="../../TestwithDAS/RunEngineTest/RunEngineTest.htm#RTDDriver"> RTD Driver.</a></p>
<h2 id="RTDEditor">The RTD Editor</h2>
<p>The RTD Editor is an extension of the DV-Draw editor.</p>
<p>Since the RTD Editor (displayed below) is based on the DV-Draw editor, which exists only in an English version, there is only an English version of the editor.</p>
<p class="Note">The static text option and the alternate channel names support non-English characters.</p>
<div class="Container"><img src="images/RTDEditor2.png" alt="RTD Editor 2" width="788" height="694"></div>
<p>For more information, see the DataViews documentation. The DataViews documentation can be accessed through the Properties context menu entry, which is accessed by right-clicking any active display object.</p>
<p class="Note">The Undo and Redo functions within the DataViews software do not apply to properties of the ActiveX Controls. The effects of these functions are inconsistent. If these functions are used, it is recommended that the user monitor their effects.</p>
<h3 id="DisplayObjects">Display Objects</h3>
<p>A display page is a rectangle containing a number of rectangular objects. The following types of objects are available:</p>
<ul>
  <li>drawings, including text</li> 
  <li>DataViews Graph objects</li> 
  <li>external images</li> 
  <li><a href="?2#ActiveX">RTD ActiveX Controls</a></li>
  <li>other ActiveX Controls</li>
</ul>
<h3>Predefining Edit Areas</h3>
<p>When a display page is opened in a view window, the Real-Time Display Driver automatically maximizes its size WITHOUT changing the Aspect Ratio (AR) of the display page (to prevent distortion of the display page).</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="39" rowspan="2">AR =</td>
    <td width="145"><u>page width</u></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>page height</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br>
<p>The available display space is optimized when the AR of the display page matches the AR of the view window. The AR of the display page is calculated from the Edit Area. Based on the particular system, a display template is available for each view window size and location.</p>
<p class="Note">When creating pages, care should be taken to use the appropriate template and ensure that all objects on the page are within the boundaries of the Edit Area</p>

<h4>Preparation</h4>
<p>Insert a section <strong>[EditArea]</strong> into the initialization file <em>RTDEditor.ini</em> of the RTD Editor and add one to ten paragraphs (groups of three rows each) containing the following entries:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Desc0=description of monitor with number 0</li>
  <li>Width0=&lt;width of this monitor in pixels&gt;</li>
  <li>Height0=&lt;height of this monitor in pixels&gt;</li>
</ul>
<p>This paragraph may be repeated with varying numbers indicating the respective monitor. This enables the user to use different Edit Areas for individual monitors that vary in size or for individual setting of toolbars and status bar. For details, see the sample below:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> [EditArea]<br>
    Desc0=monitor 1 (1280*1024) full screen, status bar + primary toolbar<br>
    Width0=1270<br>
    Height0=900</p>
  <p>Desc1=monitor 1 (1280*1024) full screen, status bar + toolbar page selection<br>
    Width1=1270<br>
    Height1=902</p>
  <p>Desc2=monitor 1 (1280*1024) full screen, primary toolbar only<br>
    Width2=1270<br>
    Height2=918</p>
  <p>Desc3=monitor 1 (1280*1024) full screen, toolbar page selection only<br>
    Width3=1270<br>
    Height3=920</p>
  <p>Desc4=monitor 1 (1280*1024) full screen, status bar only<br>
    Width4=1270<br>
    Height4=930</p>
  <p>Desc5=monitor 1 (1280*1024) full screen, neither status bar nor any tool bars<br>
    Width5=1270<br>
    Height5=948</p>
  <p>Desc6=monitor 7<br>
    Width6=700<br>
    Height6=420</p>
  <p>Desc7=monitor 8<br>
    Width7=800<br>
    Height7=480</p>
  <p>Desc8=monitor 9<br>
    Width8=900<br>
    Height8=540</p>
  <p>Desc9=monitor 10<br>
    Width9=1000<br>
    Height9=600</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Creating an Edit Area in the RTD  Editor</h4>
<p>To create an edit area in the RTD Editor:</p>
<ol>
  <li>From the Edit menu, select Edit Area, <strong>Create</strong>. The Size of EditArea window is displayed.</li>
  <li>Select one of the preconfigured groups. The  aspect ratio height/width is calculated automatically.</li>
  <li>Once selected, an Edit Area with the given size is created and indicated on the canvas. This object is named &lsquo;EditArea&rsquo; automatically.
  <p class="Note">Only a single Edit Area can be created.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<h4>Working with the Edit Area</h4>
<p>The Edit Area cannot be selected using the mouse. To select the Edit Area:</p>
<ol>
  <li>From the Edit menu, select Edit Area, <strong>Select</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Edit Area can be modified (resized) or deleted.</p>
<h4>Changing the aspect ratio of the  Edit Area</h4>
<p>If a given aspect ratio for the Edit Area is required, either change its width and keep the height or change the height and keep its width. To change the aspect ratio:</p>
<ol>
  <li>From the Edit menu, select Edit Area, <strong>Adapt Width</strong> or <strong>Adapt Height</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Measuring the view size using the RTD Driver</h4>
<p>The View window of the RTD Driver enables you to measure the actual size of the view. To measure the view size:</p>
<ol>
  <li>From the View menu, select <strong>Size</strong>. A message window is displayed indicating the width and height of the view in pixels.<br>
    These numbers can be entered into the <em>RTDEditor.ini</em> file to reach the required Edit Area size.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="DataVariables">Data Variables</h3>
<p>The data variables serve as a source of values to be displayed. The types of data variables are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Channels</li> 
  <li>2D Break Point Tables</li> 
  <li>3D Break Point Tables</li> 
  <li>Polynomials</li> 
  <li>Test (data describing the test)</li> 
  <li>Fullset (channels)</li>
</ul>
<div class="Container"><img src="images/DataVariables.PNG" alt="Data Variables"  width="604" height="533"></div>
<p>To use the data variables, the data variables must be connected with either a property of an ActiveX control or of a DataViews Graph object.</p>
<p>A dialogue box, showing which data variables are available, can be displayed by selecting <strong>Data Variables</strong> from the <strong>View</strong> menu. The same dialogue box is displayed when a data variable is connected to a property of an object. </p>
<p>The type of data variable, that can be connected to a property, depends on the type of object.</p>
<p>If a <em>Channel</em> is connected to a property, the value to be displayed is taken from the Current Value Table at runtime.</p>
<p>If a <em>2D Break Point Table</em> is connected to a property, either the x or the y coordinate must be chosen. The remaining coordinate must then be connected to a corresponding property.</p>
<p>If a <em>3D Break Point Table</em> is connected to a property, the object displays a curve for each x value of the table formed by the (y,z) pairs of the respective x value.</p>
<p>If a <em>Polynomial</em> is connected to a property, either the x or the y coordinate must be chosen. The remaining coordinate must then be connected to a corresponding property<em>.</em></p>
<p><em>Test</em> data is only connected to string properties. If the test data is connected to such a property, then the corresponding string is displayed.</p>
<p>To connect a Fullset channel to a property, such that for each new fullset acquired during the test run the channel value is displayed (instead of the Current Value Table), select the Channels icon in the data variables dialogue and create a new data variable. The name of the data variable must then be defined by typing into the appropriate text field on the right side of the dialogue box.</p>
<p>If all fullset values of this channel are to be displayed regardless of the name of the respective test steps, name the new data variable</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> fullset/&lt;channel name&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where &lt;channel name&gt; stands for the name of the affected channel.</p>
<p>If the channel values of a certain test step only are to  be displayed, then name the new data variable</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> &lt;test step name&gt;/&lt;channel name&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Where &lt;test step name&gt; stands for the name of the selected test step.</p>
<p class="Note">There is no support to select a correct channel name when using this method to connect a property with a fullset value</p>

<h3 id="FindVar">Finding Data Variables</h3>
<p>The pages on which a channel, a 2D break point table, or a polynomial is used can be determined via the Find variable in display pages dialogue box (below). The dialogue box is invoked by selecting <em><strong>Find in Files</strong></em> from the <em><strong>File</strong></em> menu.</p>
<div class="Container"><img src="images/EditorFind.PNG" alt="EditorFind" width="350" height="338"></div>
<p>To find the pages on which a specific variable is used:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select the variable (e.g.: <strong>Channel</strong>) from the ProDas Variable drop list.</li>
  <li>Select the item to searched for (e.g.: <strong>fCalc2i</strong>) from the ProDas Variable drop list.</li>
  <li>Select <strong>Find</strong>.<br>
    All display pages in the directory of the current engine type are searched and the pages containing the selected item are displayed in the list box.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Since the dialogue is non-modal, the display pages may be modified with the dialogue still visible. After such changes, the dialogue may be updated using the <strong>Refresh</strong> button. Selecting
a file in the list box and selecting <strong>Open</strong> causes the selected page to be read and displayed in a new view.</p>
<p>The <strong>Hide</strong> button hides the dialogue box, allowing the same information to be displayed the next time the dialogue box is invoked. The <strong>Close</strong> button closes the dialogue box without saving the contained information.</p>
<h3 id="Preferences">Preferences</h3>
<p>The User Preferences dialogue box, invoked by selecting <strong>Preferences</strong> from the <strong>File</strong> menu, contains a subset of the corresponding dialogue described in the DataViews documentation.</p>
<div class="Container"><img src="images/EditorPreferences.PNG" alt="EditorPreferences" width="383" height="286"></div>
<p>The default background and grid colors are displayed and may be edited via color selection dialogues. These colors are used when a new display page is created.</p>
<p> Dragging and rubberbanding let the user see the effect of reshaping an object while moving the control point. Dragging and rubberbanding can be turned on or off. When dragging and rubberbanding are off, the effect cannot be seen until the control point is released. The default setting is <em>On</em>.</p>
<p>Objects may be difficult to see while dragging if the object color is very close to the drawing background color, or if the colors are complementary. The available options set various color masks which result in different sets of colors being used for dragging. If the drag color is hard to see, try a different option. The default setting is <em>From Object</em>, which tries to maintain the color of the object during dragging.</p>
<p>The user can toggle between ASCII and binary format for saving files. Binary files load faster than ASCII files. Binary format is host-dependent so files in binary format may not be readable on another host. ASCII format is host-independent so if views are to be ported to another platform, save them as ASCII files. If a view is saved in ASCII, the view comment can be edited using the text editor. Do not edit any other part of the view file directly. Valid delimiters are &quot;, ', $, !, and @.</p>
<h3 id="PrintObjList">Printing the Object List</h3>
<p>The list of all objects of the active view can be printed by selecting <strong>Print</strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong>Object</strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong>List</strong> from the <strong>File</strong> menu. Printing is done via the Print Server.</p>
<h3 id="RTDESecurity">Security</h3>
<p>The RTD Editor requires at least security level 1 to save a display page. Users can either specify their username and password in the command line or be prompted for their username and password when the application starts.</p>
<p>Each user can write to any other directory, regardless of privileges. Therefore, a user without write privileges for the appropriate Engine Type level is able to configure display pages and save them elsewhere for later use in the Display Driver.</p>
<h3 id="RTDERules">Rules</h3>
<p>Rules specify the behaviour of an object or a view by describing the actions or changes which occur depending on specified events and conditions.</p>
<p>An action can be changing to another view, pause and resume reading the data and updating the display, redrawing the screen, turning off the rule engine or erasing views. Several actions that affect data are offered, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>setting a data variable to a specified value</li>
  <li>setting the value of a destination data variable to the value of a source variable</li>
  <li>increasing / decreasing the value of a data variable by a specified amount</li>
</ul>
<p>This can be used to modify the value of a channel during runtime. However, only zero hertz scan rate channels may be modified during runtime.</p>
<p><em>Do Nothing</em> is the default action selection and can be used to disable a rule for testing purposes or as a place holder when there is no action for the rule.</p>
<p>Each rule can be tied to a specific event such as a mouse click or a key push.</p>
<p>A condition can be which mouse button was clicked, which keyboard key was pushed, or whether or not data values meet specified criteria. </p>
<p>The rules are specified in the property dialogue which is displayed after a click with the right mouse button in the object or view, selecting the <em>Properties</em> entry and the <em>Rules</em> tab. In the following example, the <em>Vector Text</em> object named <em>Equation</em> (i.e.: VectorText:Equation) sets the value of the data variable <em>fCalc1i</em> to 1000 every time the user clicks with the mouse button.</p>
<div class="Container"> <img alt="Rules" src="images/Rules.PNG"></div>
<p>The following action types are not supported by the RTD Driver and should not be used:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Faster</li> 
  <li>Slower</li> 
  <li>Execute Command</li> 
  <li>Execute Function in Script</li> 
  <li>Write Data Variable to Data Variable</li> 
  <li>Call Generated Handler</li> 
  <li>Overlay View</li> 
  <li>Erase Overlay View</li> 
  <li>Overlay Object</li> 
  <li>Erase Overlay Object</li> 
  <li>Erase Visible Overlays</li> 
  <li>Popup Object at Cursor</li> 
  <li>Erase Popup Object</li> 
  <li>Erase Visible Popups</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information, see Using Rules in the DataView documentation.</p>
<h3 id="RTDEDynamics">Dynamics</h3>
<p>Dynamic components may be added to an object so that changes occur to the object when the data changes.<br>
  The dynamic components, also called dynamic features, are listed in the following table:</p>
<table class="Table-Grey">
  <tr>
    <th>Components</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Attribute dynamics</td>
    <td>Changes properties such as color, line type, line width, curve type and arc direction.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Motion dynamics</td>
    <td>Changes position, rotation, and scale.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Subdrawing dynamics</td>
    <td>Displays different subdrawings depending on a data value.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Visibility dynamics</td>
    <td>Changes whether or not the object is visible.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Text dynamics</td>
    <td>Changes the content of a text object to display the data value.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Blinking dynamics</td>
    <td>Alternates the colors of an object between two sets of colors to make the object blink. An object can blink or not blink, or blink in different colors, depending on a data value.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Fill dynamics</td>
    <td>Changes fill effects of a filled graphical object.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Dynamic features that do not apply to the type of the currently selected object are disabled.</p>
<p>The dynamic features are specified in the property dialogue which is displayed after clicking with the right mouse button in the object and selecting the <strong>Properties</strong> entry and the <strong>Dynamic</strong> tab. In the example, the text of the Vector Text object named <em>Equation</em> is set to x = &lt;data value of channel <em>fCalc1i</em>&gt;. At the same time, the object rotates according to the value of this channel.</p>
<div class="Container"> <img alt="Dynamics" src="images/Dynamics.PNG"></div>
<div class="Container"> <img alt="Dynamics Example" src="images/DynamicsExample.PNG"></div>
<p>For more information, see Using Object Dynamics in the DataView documentation.</p>
<h3 id="RTDEError">Error Window</h3>
<p>The error window displays all errors which have occurred in the application since it was called and which have not yet been cleared. Errors are listed in chronological order with the time when they occurred. The latest error is at the bottom.</p>
<p>When an error occurs, the error window pops into the foreground. The Errors window can also be displayed by selecting <strong>Show Errors</strong> from the <strong>Window</strong> menu.</p>
<p>The selection in the window or the complete content can be cleared using the corresponding button. The window can be hidden by clicking the <em>Hide</em> button.</p>
<div class="Container"><img alt="Error Window" src="images/ErrorWindow.png"></div>
<h3 id="RTDEPageAdmin">Page Administration</h3>
<p>Page sequences serve to navigate quickly through sequences of related pages at runtime (i.e.: using the RTD Driver). A dialogue to administrate these sequences can be invoked by selecting <strong>Page Sequence</strong> from the <strong>File</strong> menu.</p>
<div class="Container"><img alt="PageSequence" src="images/PageSequence.PNG"></div>
<p>In the dialogue, all existing page sequences are displayed in a list box. A new page sequence can be created by clicking the <em>New</em> button in the dialogue. The selected page sequence can be renamed, copied or deleted by clicking the corresponding button.</p>
<p>The display pages of the selected page sequence are displayed in the second list box. The third list box shows the available pages of the current engine type which are not contained in the page sequence. If a page is selected in one of these list boxes, it may be moved to the other by clicking the appropriate arrow button.</p>
<h3 id="RTDENavBar">Navigation Bar</h3>
<p>The navigation bar displays the default configuration as the current configuration.</p>
<div class="Container"><img alt="NavigationBar" src="images/NavigationBar.png" width="700" height="18"></div>
<p>To change the current configuration, close all open Views/Pages/Subdrawings and use the Configuration menu.</p>
<h3 id="RTDEGenProp">The General Properties Dialogue</h3>
<p>The general properties dialogue is invoked via the <strong>Context</strong> menu. If an object is selected, the properties of the object are displayed. In the case of multiple selection, the dialogue of the first object is displayed. If no object is selected, the property dialogue of the page is displayed. The property dialogue of the page can also be invoked by selecting <em>Properties</em> from the <em>View menu</em>. The general property page of an object can also be invoked by double clicking the object. </p>
<div class="Container"> <img alt="PropertiesActiveX" src="images/PropertiesActiveX.PNG" ></div>
<p>The <em>ActiveX</em> tab is only available for ActiveX controls and serves to connect DataViews variables with properties exposed by ActiveX controls. The properties that are exposed depends on the type of the control. The data variables dialogue is invoked by clicking the check box in the <em>Map</em> column or by clicking the three dots in the <em>Variable Name</em> column.</p>
<h3 id="RTDEContextMenu">The Context Menu</h3>
<p>A context menu is displayed by right clicking a view. The Context Menu (with selection and without selection are displayed and described in the table below).</p>
<div><img src="images/ContextEditor.PNG" alt="Context Editor" width="210" height="302">   <img src="images/ContextEditorNoselect.PNG" alt="Context Editor Noselect" width="160" height="176"></div>

  </tr>
</table>
<p class="Note">Ensure the context menu is properly closed (by clicking any empty space on the screen) before opening the context menu for a different display object. The context menu changes if the selection changes, but the functions may not work properly.</p>
<h3 id="RTDESimulation">Simulation</h3>
<p>The behaviour of a display page during runtime can be simulated. Simulation mode is entered by selecting <em>Run</em> from the <em>Test </em> menu. If a graphical DataViews object or an RTD ActiveX Control is connected with a data variable, values for this data variable are simulated. In most cases, a <em>sine</em>-like function is used.</p>
<p>There is a control panel (i.e.: a small window), which is always on top of the Preview and Simulation window, that allows the following manipulations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>zoom in and out</li> 
  <li>zoom/pan reset (i.e.: restore the original size)</li> 
  <li>pan in a direction (i.e.: move the visible part in one of four directions)</li> 
  <li>drag rectangular area to zoom</li> 
  <li>choose point to pan (i.e.: the clicked point becomes the middle of the drawing area)</li> 
  <li>show a thumbnail of the page</li>
</ul>
<div class="Container"><img alt="Simulation" src="images/Simulation.png" ></div>
<p>If the control panel is hidden, it can be made visible by clicking the <em>Show control panel</em> button. The simulated page can be printed with the <em>Print</em> button. The frequency of the simulated data can be changed in the frequency spin control. The simulation can be paused by releasing the <em>Run</em> button. In pause mode, a step can be made by clicking the <em>Step</em> button. Finally, the window can be closed with the <em>Close</em> button.</p> 
<p class="Note">The display simulation  displays the changing values for all controls, whether the channel associated with this control has a scan rate above zero or not.</p>
<h3 id="Groups">Object Groups</h3>
<p>It is possible to combine several objects into a group. Groups can be used to move or resize objects while keeping the relationship to  each other. The following is possible:</p>
<ul>
  <li>create a new group (&quot;Group&quot;)</li>
  <li>dissolve a group (&quot;Ungroup&quot;)</li>
  <li>recreate the most recently dissolved group (&quot;Regroup&quot;)</li>
</ul>
<p>A group can be defined by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>selecting objects and groups to be combined to a new group</li>
  <li>selecting <strong>Group</strong> from the <strong>Object</strong> menu</li>
</ul>
<p>A group can be dissolved by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>selecting  the group that to be dissolved</li>
  <li>selecting <strong>UnGroup</strong> from the <strong>Object</strong> menu</li>
</ul>
<p>The most recently dissolved group can be restored by (if there elements are still available):</p>
<ul>
  <li>selecting <strong>ReGroup</strong> from the <strong>Object</strong> menu</li>
</ul>
<p>A group can be moved selecting one element of the group so that the whole group is selected (the surrounding rectangle is displayed). Once selected, the surrounding rectangle can be moved.</p>
<h2 id="ActiveX">RTD ActiveX Controls</h2>
<p>Even though the DataViews software package is shipped with a large variety of display objects, additional display objects within the RTD Editor and RTD Driver are offered to meet the special needs of the proDAS display system and provide the user with a maximum degree of flexibility in configuring these objects.</p>
<p>Since ActiveX controls are widely application independent display objects, the RTD ActiveX Controls available within the proDAS RTD environment can also be used in other software packages with a minimum effort for adaptation.</p>
<p>It is also possible to insert other ActiveX Controls (aside from the RTD ActiveX Controls) into a display page within the RTD Editor and display this page in the RTD Driver during runtime. However, such a control  has no special support in connecting to a proDAS channel or to reference data, such as breakpoint tables and polynomials.</p>
<p>The RTD ActiveX Controls provide the following functionalities:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="?32#MapChannels">Map Channels to ActiveX Control</a></li>
  <li><a href="?3#GeneralControlProp">RTDValue Properties Dialogue</a></li>

<h3 id="MapChannels">Map Channels to ActiveX Control</h3>
<p>For any ActiveX Control, another dialogue can be launched to map the required channels to the properties of the ActiveX Control. This Channel Mapping Dialogue can be displayed by double-clicking the ActiveX Control or by selecting the menu item <strong>Map Channels&hellip;</strong> from the context menu or from the main <strong>Object</strong> menu.</p>
<p class="Note">Channels cannot be mapped to the bevel control. The Map Channels option in the bevel context menu is disabled.</p>
<div class="Container"><img src="images/MapChannels.png" alt="Map Channels" width="700" height="542"></div>
<p>To map a channel to an ActiveX Control:</p>
<p class="Note">The channel mapping dialogue supports filtering by subsystem type and subsystem name.</p>
<p class="Note">The General Properties Dialogue must be used to map a 3D breakpoint table to an ActiveX Control. Within the ActiveX tab of the dialogue, select the CurveArray property, select a 3D Break Point Table as a variable name, and click Close.</p>
<ol>
  <li>From the Subsystem type, select the desired subsystem.</li>
  <li>From the Subsystem name, select the desired subsystem.</li>
  <li>From the Select a Channel panel, select the desired channel.</li>
  <li>Select the Map To button to map the selected channel to the respective property.</li>
  <li>If the control is to display fullset values only, check the Fullset box.</li>
  <li>If the fullset values are to be restricted to certain test steps only, enter the name of the test step in the Test Step Name field or select a test step from the drop-down list.<br>
    <br>
    <p class="Note">The drop-down list contains all used names of test steps.</p>
  </li>
  <li>If an ActiveX Control only has a single mappable property, double-clicking a channel in the Select a Channel panel selects the channel, maps it to the single property and closes the dialogue.<br>
    If an ActiveX Control has more mappable properties than can be displayed simultaneously, the currently invisible properties can be displayed by using the vertical scroll bar on the right hand side.</li>
  <li>To remove any mapping, select <strong>Clear</strong>.</li>
  <li>To discard all modifications and close the Map Channels to ActiveX Controls window, select <strong>Cancel</strong>.</li>
  <li>To accept and process all modifications and close the Map Channels to ActiveX Controls window, select <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p class="Note">Mapping any data variable other than a channel can only be achieved using the data variables dialogue.</p>
<h3 id="GeneralControlProp">The RTDValue Properties Dialogue</h3>
<p>Each RTD ActiveX control has a properties dialogue to define the layout and behaviour of the control. This properties dialogue is available in the RTD Editor and in the RTD Driver, but in the driver only a subset of the properties may be changed. The property dialogue may be invoked by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>selecting <i><em>Additional Properties ... </em></i> from the context menu</li>
  <li>double clicking in the RTD Driver</li>
  <li>selecting the <em>More Properties</em> button in the generic property dialogue of the RTD Editor</li>
</ul>
<p> The RTDValue Properties dialogue has the following buttons:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>OK</em> to apply the changes and terminate the dialogue</li>
  <li><em>Cancel</em> to finish the dialogue without any further change</li>
  <li><em>Apply</em> to apply the pending changes (the <em>Apply</em> button is only enabled if the user has made changes)</li>
  <li><em>Help</em> to invoke the online help</li>
</ul>
<p class="Note">It may be required to click the OK or Cancel buttons more than once to close the dialogue box.</p>

<h3 id="YXPlotControl">The RTD Y/X Plot Control</h3>
<p>A RTD Y/X Plot Control displays one channel over another in a diagram. Up to 50 such pairs can be displayed in the same diagram. </p>
<p>A separate y axis may be displayed for each y value, but there is only one common x axis and therefore, it is recommended that only channels with the same engineering unit and similar ranges be used as x values.</p>
<p class="Note">The x values may be the same for several curves.</p>
<p>A legend may be displayed, to the right of the diagram, that shows the current value, name, and engineering unit for each x and y value of the diagram. If a y value does not have a y axis, then the range of the y value is also displayed.</p>
<p class="Note">If the values on the chart go outside the displayed x or y range, then the display ranges are resized automatically to display all the data points.</p>

<h4 id="PropConCurveArr">The RTDYXPlot Properties Dialogue</h4>
<p>The RTDYXPlot Properties dialogue exposes the properties <em>XValuen</em> and <em>YValuen</em> which may be connected with a channel, a fullset channel, a coordinate of a 2D break point table, or a coordinate of a polynomial. Here, <em>n</em> is a two digit number ranging from 01 to 50. To define a curve, <em>both XValuen</em> and <em>YValuen</em> must be connected. The type of data variable must be the same for both. For 2D break point tables and polynomials, the corresponding coordinates of the same 2D break point table or polynomial, respectively, must be selected.</p>
<p>The RTDYXPlot Properties dialogue also exposes the <em>CurveArray</em> property, which may be connected with a 3D break point table. If so, then for each x value of the 3D break point table, a curve is displayed. The y parameter of the table serves as the x value and the z parameter as the y value in the diagram.</p>
<p>The RTDYXPlot Properties dialogue for the RTD Y/X Plot Control has three tabs. The first tab, Properties of RTD Y/X Plot Control, is for general properties that are described in the Properties of the Y/X Plot Control table. The second tab is the <a href="?13#ColorTab"><em>Color</em></a> tab.</p>

<h3 id="HexControl">The RTD Hex Control</h3>
<p>The RTD Hex Control displays values in hexadecimal or binary format whereby it is possible to display only a portion (bit range) of the values. Items can be ordered horizontally or vertically.</p>
<div class="Container"><img src="images/HexControl.png" alt="Hex Control" width="400" height="349"></div>
<p>The display consists of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>channel name (or alternate name)</li>
  <li>selected bit range</li>
  <li>channel value</li>
  <li>quality of channel value</li>
</ul>
<p>The RTD Hex Control is able to process channel values ranging from 262144 (lowest signed/negative 19-bit-value) up to 524287 (highest unsigned/positive 19-bit-value) as integer numbers. Values outside the range of 262144&ndash;524287 are considered invalid values and cannot be properly displayed.</p>

<h2 id="PaletteItem">Creating a Palette Item for an ActiveX Control</h2>
<p>There are two types of sub-drawings (or palette items) available:</p>
<ul>
  <li>sub-drawings based on image, text control, other sub-drawings, lines, etc. (created using  DV-Draw or the RTD Editor)</li>
  <li>sub-drawings based on external ActiveX component (created using DV-Draw only)</li>
</ul>
<p>The RTD Editor can be used to initially create a palette item with an ActiveX Control with the proper ini file setting.</p>
<p>DV-Draw must be used to create a palette item for an ActiveX Control. Each palette item is represented by a subdrawing, (i.e. there is a respective subdrawing file and a bitmap file with an image of the subdrawing). For further details, refer to the DV-Draw Help menu.</p>
<p>To begin creating a palette item for an ActiveX Control, start DV-Draw with an empty view.</p>
<h3>Creating the Data Source</h3>
<p>Although it is possible to create a sub-drawing that is not mapped to any data object (constant, variable, etc), an ActiveX Control looks better if it is bound to some data variables.</p>
<p>To create the data source:</p>
<ol>
  <li>From the Edit menu (DV-Draw) or the View menu (RTD Editor), select <strong>Data Variables...</strong>. The Data Selection window is displayed.
    <div class="Container"><img src="images/DataSelection.png" alt="Data Selection" width="604" height="530"></div>
  </li>
  <li>Remove all data sources. From the Data Source List, select all data sources and push the delete button.
    <p class="Note">If this step is skipped, the sub-drawing file contains information about all data sources (i.e. channels, breakpoint tables, polynomials, etc.) which is useless for a generic palette item. Since this may sum up to thousands of records, it is recommended for RTD Editor users to use an empty configuration when creating or modifying a palette item.</p>
  </li>
  <li>From the New Data Source drop-down list, select <strong>Constant</strong>.</li>
  <li>Create a new data source by selecting the <strong>Add New Data Source</strong> button.</li>
  <li>Enter the string &quot;Channels&quot; in the <strong>File Origin:</strong> textbox.</li>
  <li>To close the Data Selection window, select <strong>Close</strong>.
    <p class="Note">The RTD Editor uses another data source named Channels for the proDAS channels; the type of this data source is Files as opposed to the Constant data source created herein.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>Customizing DV-Draw: Option &ldquo;Insert an ActiveX Control&rdquo;</h3>
<p>This option is not displayed by default when DV-Draw starts. To display the &ldquo;Create an ActiveX Control&rdquo; option: Add the button ActiveX to the Object Creation toolbar:</p>
<ol>
  <li>From the Tools menu, select Customize. The Customize window is displayed.
    <div class="Container"><img src="images/Customize.png" alt="Customize" width="422" height="342"></div>
  </li>
  <li>Select the <strong>Commands</strong> tab.</li>
  <li>From the Categories: list select the toolbar <strong>Object Creation</strong>.</li>
  <li>From the Commands: panel, click-and-drag <img src="images/BtnActiveX.png" alt="Button ActiveX" width="24" height="24"> (ActiveX button) onto the Object Creation toolbar.</li>
  <li>To close the Customize window, select <strong>Close</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Inserting an ActiveX Control into a View</h3>
<p>To create an ActiveX control object:</p>
<ol>
  <li>From the Create Object toolbar, select <img src="images/BtnActiveX.png" alt="Button ActiveX" width="24" height="24">. The Insert Control window is displayed.
    <div class="Container"><img src="images/InsertControl.png" alt="Insert Control" width="452" height="344"></div>
  </li>
  <li>From the Control: list, select the desired control type and select <strong>OK</strong>.
    <p class="Note">The fastest way to reach the RTD ActiveX Controls is by entering the letter &quot;s&quot;.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Click and drag to define a rectangle for the location of the ActiveX Control.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Configuring the ActiveX Control</h3>
<h4>Properties and Variable Mapping</h4>
<p>You can now configure the ActiveX Control as desired (i.e. create appropriate data variables and map them to the ActiveX Control and define its properties). Since configuring the ActiveX Control is best achieved using the RTD Editor, save the view to a file and  open it again in the RTD Editor.</p>
<p>Whether using DV-Draw or the RTD Editor, make sure that there is no other data source than the Constant data source named Channels. If any variables are to be mapped to the ActiveX Control, create new variables in this Constant data source named Channels.</p>
<p>Since some ActiveX Controls may look quite differently depending on the configured properties, it may be worth while creating multiple instances of the ActiveX Control displaying different properties.</p>
<h4>Position of the ActiveX Control</h4>
<p>To ensure the center point of the ActiveX Control or graphical object is identical with the origin of the coordinates used in the view:</p>
<ol>
  <li>From the View menu, select Grid to display the grid. The origin is indicated by a cross.</li>
  <li>Move the AcitveX Control so that its center is over the origin.
    <p class="Note">Not positioning the control's center to the origin  results in a wrong position of the control once dragged from the palette and placed onto a view.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>Adding an Item to the Palette</h3>
<p>Adding an item to the palette takes the currently selected object and creates a sub-drawing file containing a copy of the object in the palette directory structure.</p>
<h4>Adding a Palette Item</h4>
<p>To add a subdrawing item to the palette:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Go to the appropriate tab in the palette.<br>
    The new item is added to the current palette tab. If you have not yet created a tab for this item, see Adding Tabs to the Palette in the DV-Draw documentation.</li>
  <li>Select the ActiveX Control.</li>
  <li>Right click and select &ldquo;Add to Palette&rdquo; from the context menu.
    <p class="Note">A sub-drawing might be added to the palette by saving it directly into the palette folder. However, in this case it  appears on the palette window only after restarting DV-Draw or the RTD Editor. The subsequent step is not required in this case.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<h4>Renaming the Palette Item</h4>
<p>The new item is given a default name of Group#.sd, where # is the next number not already used. The first item you add using this method is named <em>Group0.sd</em>, the second is <em>Group1.sd</em>, etc. If you change these default names, their numbers are used again. Therefore, the palette item should be renamed. To rename the palette item:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open the palette directory (defined in the <em>RTDEditor.ini</em> file in the section <strong>General</strong> as item <strong>DVPaletteDir</strong>) and its subdirectory named identically to the palette tab into which the new item has been inserted.</li>
  <li>Rename the file (e.g. rename <em>Group#.sd</em> to <em>MultiSwitch.sd</em>).</li>
</ol>
<h3>Creating a Bitmap</h3>
<p>Create a bitmap using an appropriate tool (e.g. MS Paint, or by capturing a screen shot of the ActiveX Control) and store this bitmap in a file in the same palette subdirectory as the respective sub-drawing file under the same name as the sub-drawing file (the extension of the bitmap file must be &ldquo;.gif&rdquo;, &ldquo;.bmp&rdquo; or &ldquo;.dib&rdquo;). Using  Windows Explorer, make the bitmap file hidden.</p>
<h3>Testing the Palette Item</h3>
<p>The palette displays the newly added ActiveX Control, indicated by the bitmap image and the name of the sub-drawing file.</p>
<p>If the preview window of the palette is activated, clicking on the palette item  shows the ActiveX Control in the preview window as it is configured in the sub-drawing file. When the palette item is dragged and dropped onto the view, it is displayed at the dropping location; its visual appearance is defined by the configuration of the ActiveX Control in the sub-drawing file.</p>
<p>The appropriate proDAS channels, breakpoint tables or polynomials must be mapped to the ActiveX Control and the properties of the ActiveX Control can be adapted.</p>
