<h3 id="Hyperlinks">Hyperlinks</h3>
<p>Hyperlinks, denoted by coloured underlined text ( <a href="#Hyperlinks">Hyperlinks</a> ), are text items that are linked to another page or paragraph that directly relates and supports the hyperlinked item. The Hyperlink allows for rapid transport from one location in the MDS Product Support Manual to another. By placing the mouse cursor over a hyperlink, the cursor image changes from an arrow to a white hand with a pointing finger<img width="54" height="31" alt="" src="images/hyperlink.png">. Clicking the cursor while over a hyperlink opens the page containing the information indicated by the hyperlink in the main viewing area. All topics listed in each information module are linked to the related subject matter. Click on any hyperlinked topic to display the subject in the main viewing area.</p>
<p>Hyperlinks found within the system write-ups display related information. The link may be specific (i.e. Click here to...) or implied and embedded in the main text. In either case, click on the link to display the associated information in the main window.</p>
<p>It is recommended that your browser history be cleared regularly to reset all links back to the active  colour. See <a href="../../References/HowTos/ClearBrowser.html">How To - Clear your Browser History</a>.</p>
