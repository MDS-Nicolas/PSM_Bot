<h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The configuration editors are the user interfaces that allow the operator to setup and control proDAS configurations. All of the configuration editors share some common features. An overview of these features is provided in this module.</p>
<p>The following editors are available to the operator:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="../ChannelEditor/ChannelEditor.htm">Channel Editor</a> - used to create and edit <a href="../ConfigAdmin/ConfigAdmin.htm#WhatisaChannel">channel</a> definitions (the definitions include the channel name, limits, and associated 
  subsystems)</li>
  <li><a href="../SubsystemEditor/SubsystemEditor.htm">Subsystem Editor</a> - used to create and edit subsystem definitions (the definitions include the subsystem name, type, and specific hardware data)</li>
  <li><a href="../../DASConfigTools/EUEditor/EUEditor.htm">Engineering Unit Editor</a> - used to create and edit engineering unit definitions (the definitions include the unit name, group, and its relationship to the group primary unit)</li>
  <li><a href="../../DASConfigTools/PolyEditor/PolyEditor.htm">Polynomial Editor</a> - used to create and edit polynomial definitions (the definitions include the polynomial name and its associated coefficients)</li>
  <li><a href="../../DASConfigTools/BPTableEditor/BPTableEditor.htm">Breakpoint Table Editor</a> - used to create and edit breakpoint table definitions (the definitions include the breakpoint table name, engineering units, and table entries)</li>
  <li><a href="../../DASConfigTools/TransLogDefnEditor/TransLogDefnEditor.htm">Transient Log Definition Editor</a> - used to create and edit transient log definitions (the definitions include the transient log name, scan rate, and associated channels)</li>
  <li><a href="../../DASConfigTools/MacroEditor/MacroEditor.htm">Macro Editor</a> - used to create and edit macro definitions (the definitions include the macro name and text)</li>
  <li> <a href="../../DASConfigTools/UserFunctions/UserFunctions.htm">User Functions</a> - used to create and edit user function definitions (the definitions include the user function name and text)</li>
  <li><a href="../../DASConfigTools/TextOutputPages/TextOutputPages.htm">Text Output Pages</a> - used to create and edit the text output page definitions (the definitions include the name, size, and layout of the output page)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="UserSecurity">User Security</h2>
<p>A configuration editor can be started in one of two ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>via the Management GUI Control Panel where the username and password are passed automatically</li>
  <li>as an independent editor where the username and password are not passed automatically</li>
</ul>
<h4>To start a configuration editor from the Management GUI Control Panel:</h4>
<ol>
  <li>From the Tools menu, select the applicable editor. The selected editor is started and a <strong>Processing...</strong> dialogue box is displayed to prevent the user from doing anything until the  configuration data is loaded. Once loaded, the main screen for the editor is displayed.
    <p class="Note">The operator is automatically logged into the editor with the same user name and privileges as entered for the Management GUI.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<h4>To start a configuration editor as an independent editor:</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Double-click the executable file, from your directory structure, for the applicable editor.<br>
    The Login window is displayed.
    <div class="Container"><img src="Images/Login.png" alt="Login" width="407" height="272"></div>
  </li>
  <li>Enter a valid Username and Password.<br>
    The user name and password must be a minimum of three characters and five characters long, respectively, to enable the <strong>Login</strong> button.</li>
  <li>Select <strong>Login</strong>.<br>
    The selected editor is started and a <strong>Processing...</strong> dialogue box is displayed to prevent the user from doing anything until the configuration data is loaded. Once loaded, the main screen for the editor is displayed.</li>
  <li>To close the Login window, select <strong>Cancel</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="GraphicalElements">Graphical Elements</h2>
<p>The screen comprises the following graphical elements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>pull-down menus</li>
  <li>buttons</li>
  <li>navigation bar if the editor is configuration dependent
    <div class="Container"><img src="Images/Navigation.png" alt="Navigation" width="700" height="17"></div>
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>splitter windows:
    <ul>
      <li>list of data records as a spreadsheet on the left</li>
      <li>detailed information of the specific data record selected on the left f the data record has specific data (i.e.: data that is not common for all data records of a specific data category)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>window for the list of messages</li>
</ul>
<p>The generic functionalities are accessed by the following menus and columns:</p>

<h2 id="RegExpr">Regular Expressions</h2>
<p>A regular expression is a series of characters that define a pattern. The pattern is then compared to a target string to see whether there are any matches of the pattern in the target string. Often, the characters in a pattern will simply match themselves in the target string, such as looking for all occurrences of the pattern <strong>the</strong> in "the quick brown fox chased the lazy dog".</p>
<p>Special characters, called meta-characters, can also be used to indicate character positioning, grouping, and repetition (e.g.: the use of the asterisk (*) as a wildcard for matching any character when doing a directory search in DOS is an example of a regular expression meta-character).</p>
<p>It is also possible to search for pattern sequences using regular expressions (e.g.: the regular expression [a-c] will match any a, b, or c in the target string.</p>
<p>Regular expressions include several special meta-character and sequences to allow more complex pattern matching. Negative character, digit sets, and ranges can also be expressed (e.g.: [^abc] will match any characters not enclosed in brackets). An expression (e.g.: [^m-q]) can also be written for a negative range.</p>
