<h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The DDS Subsystem provides the interface to control the following Dynamic Data System (DDS) operations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>load and select  the  test definition file</li>
  <li>command the DDS to select the next available disk set</li>
  <li>place the DDS into MONITORING mode</li>
  <li>place the DDS into READY mode</li>
</ul>
<p>During proDAS configuration, or upon a request from the Management Interface, the DDS Subsystem transmits the DDS configuration file from the proDAS system to the DDS.</p>
<h3 id="EDASCommunication">DDS - proDAS Communication</h3>
<p>The DDS software driver communicates with the Dynamic Data System (DDS) through a TCP/IP Ethernet connection. The driver provides an interface between the systems for file transfer. During configuration of the DDS System, or if requested from the Management Interface,  proDAS transmits a configuration file to the DDS that is based upon information in the proDAS database.</p>
<p>The proDAS driver notifies the operator of communication problems with the DDS, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a broken Ethernet connection</li>
  <li>configuration errors in DDS</li>
  <li>file transfer errors</li>
</ul>
<p>The DDS Subsystem receives unsolicited status messages from the DDS to maintain the state of the DDS and for error tracing purposes. UEL messages include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&quot;Failed to connect to the DDS&quot; </li>
  <li>&quot;Established connection to the DDS&quot;</li>
  <li>&quot;Lost connection to the DDS&quot;</li>
  <li>&quot;Recovered connection to the DDS&quot;</li>
  <li>&quot;Failed to configure the DDS&quot;</li>
  <li>&quot;Failed to transition the DDS into MONITORING mode&quot;</li>
  <li>&quot;Failed to transition the DDS into READY mode&quot;</li>
  <li>&quot;Request to reconfigure the DDS ignored, another request is already in progress&quot;</li>
  <li>&quot;Failed to reconfigure the DDS: Not connected&quot;</li>
  <li>&quot;Failed to reconfigure the DDS: Internal error&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>For successful messages, the UEL messages include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&quot;DDS successfully transitioned into READY mode&quot;</li>
  <li>&quot;DDS successfully transitioned into MONITORING mode&quot;</li>
  <li>&quot;File transfer of dynamic file &lt;file name&gt; to the DDS succeeded&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Operation">Operation</h2>
<p>The DDS operates as a server to the DDS Subsystem. Functions within the DDS Subsystem send requests to the DDS to perform the required operations.</p>
<p>The following information is read from the RTE <strong>.config</strong> file:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hostname of the DDS</li>
  <li>TCP Service Name for DDS communication</li>
  <li>Timeout for communication</li>
  <li>Test Definition File remote path for file transfers</li>
  <li>Time Out for transition to Monitoring Mode</li>
</ul>
<p>Files that contain configuration definitions for the Dynamic System are imported through the <a href="../../CustomApps/CIE/CIE.htm">Configuration Import / Export Utility</a>.</p>
<h2 id="ChanDefns">DDS Configuration Definitions</h2>
<p>proDAS collects and stores engine test data by channels. Channels are grouped by subsystem. A channel definition file (sometimes referred to as a configuration file) is created for the Dynamic Data System (DDS). The difference with this file is that it contains multiple sections, none of which include the generic channel definitions.</p>
<p>Each section starts with a line containing only the word START, followed by a &quot;space&quot; (not a &quot;tab&quot;) and the label of the section. For example, the device header section begins with START DEVICE_HEADER. The end of a section is indicated by a line containing only the word END, followed by a &quot;space&quot; (not a &quot;tab&quot;) and the label of the section. For example, the device header section ends with END DEVICE_HEADER.</p>
<p>The file must contain all sections in the order below. Each section  contains specific columns as noted in the section descriptions below:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="?2#DeviceHeader">Device Header</a>(DEVICE_HEADER)</li>
  <li><a href="?4#DAS333">DAS333 Channels</a>(DASS333)</li>

<p>The label for this section is DEVICE_HEADER. The section has one line for each telemetry unit. <a href="../../CustomApps/CIE/CIE.htm#ConfigImportExport">Configuration Import/Export Utility</a> generates the proDAS <a href="../DDTC/DDTC.htm">DDTC Subsystem</a> configuration from this section.

These features can be associated with any of the channels, but are only used if the channel is selected for Fast Fourrier Transform (FFT) analysis (see <a href="?20#SelectionDefn">DDART Selection Definition</a> for details). The WARNING_LEVEL parameters either define a constant warning level (if only one point is specified) equal to the <a href="?21#WarnLevelLimit">WARNING_LEVEL_LIMIT</a> value, or a break point table consisting of a list of <a href="?22#WarnLevelRPM">WARNING_LEVEL_RPM</a> and WARNING_LEVEL_LIMIT ordered pairs. These speed-limit pairs define a staircase profile, where the speed for a particular value pair defines the lowest speed at which the limit is applicable, and the limit to be applied is constant between value pairs (i.e. not interpolated between limit values).</p>
