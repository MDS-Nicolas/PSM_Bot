  <tr> 
    <td>Channel</td>
    <td>A channel is the basic structure for collecting, storing and processing data. Normally, it consists of an instrumentation signal source (e.g. transducer), a storage location in the <strong>current value table</strong> (CVT) for the data, and all of the hardware (cables, signal conditioners, converters...) and associated software between them.<br>
        <br>Channels can be used to transmit data to other systems. In this case, the channel signal source is the CVT, and the final destination is a storage location in the receiving system.<br>

        The log can be set to save data from before and after an event. For example, a log could save the three minutes of data before the save command is issued, and the next two minutes of data after the save command. This allows analysis of data before and after a particular event or problem.</td>

    <td>The preparation (excitation, amplification, filtering and analogue-to-digital conversion) of raw data for interpretation by the RTE.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>Signal Source</td>
    <td>A device that generates an electrical signal in response to measuring a physical quantity (such as a temperature or pressure) for interpretation by the RTE.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>Subsystem</td>
    <td>A Subsystem is a discrete group of instrumentation, such as the General Analogue Subsystem, that supplies engine test data, support facility, or infrastructure data to proDAS (see also <strong>Subsystem Configuration</strong>). Subsystems are normally concerned with a specific type of related data, such as temperature or vibration. <strong>Note</strong>: in general discussions, &quot;<strong>system</strong>&quot; and &quot;<strong>subsystem</strong>&quot; are frequently used interchangeably, depending on the context of the conversation.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>Subsystem Configuration</td>
    <td>A Subsystem Configuration consists of a set of <strong>channel</strong> definitions that define how the RTE processes the data from a <strong>subsystem</strong>. In this case, &quot;subsystem&quot; refers specifically to a subset of a <strong>master configuration</strong>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Transient Log</td>
    <td>Transient logs are user-defined time-based records of data acquired by selected channels. The Transient Log definition specifies the name of the log, the time that the log runs, the sampling frequency, and the channels recorded by the log.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>Two Point Linear Calibration</td>
    <td>A calibration method of acquiring two points to generate a slope and offset for engineering unit conversion.</td>

  <tr> 
    <td>User Log</td>
    <td>Refer to <strong>Transient Log</strong>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>Warning</td>
    <td>A warning notifies the operator that the value of a channel has reached a warning <strong>limit</strong>. Warning limits are defined in the channel definition and are recorded in the <strong>Event Log</strong>. Warnings may have to be acknowledged by the operator depending on how the system was configured.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>Zero</td>
    <td>The operation of removing an offset of an analogue input signal by adjusting the engineering unit conversion at the static zero condition.    </td>
