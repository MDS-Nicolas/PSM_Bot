<h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The Replay Control Graphical User Interface (GUI) is a VCR-style control panel that allows the user to control the Replay component of the Real-Time Engine (RTE). The Replay Control GUI is opened by the Management GUI on completion of the RTE configuration. Replay mode allows the user to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>select a log file for replay</li>
  <li>move to a specific time in the log file </li>
  <li>select the log file replay speed</li>
  <li>start, stop, pause and continue the replay</li>
  <li>single step forward or backward</li>
  <li>move forward or backward in time at the selected replay speed</li>
</ul>
<p>During the replay of a selected log, the user can record fullsets and transient logs, execute test procedures and External Hooks Programs, monitor alarms, and do any other function normally performed in real-time data acquisition.</p>

<p>The Replay Control GUI is shown below and described in the following table.</p>

      <br>
      The value 1.0 represents normal playback.<br>

      A value greater than 1 causes the log to skip samples during playback (e.g.: a speed factor of 5 would process every fifth sample in a log file). <br>
