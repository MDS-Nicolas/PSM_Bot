<p class="Note">The Management GUI Tools menu is configurable. The contents of each main category is customised for every customer to display only the functions applicable to that customer.</p>
<h2 id="PreTest">Pre Test Functions</h2>
<p>proDAS gives the operator the ability to run various Pre Test Functions prior to acquiring data. These tests may allow the user to perform functions such as confirming channel readings are within the appropriate ranges, and zeroing temperature and pressure channels. The following Pre Test Functions, as applicable, can be performed:</p>
<p class="Note">The Management GUI associates each function with a configurable user level such that only authorised users can perform these functions.</p>

<h3 id="ZeroPurgePressChan">Zeroing or Purging Pressure Scanner Channels (PBS)</h3>
<p class="Note">The following terminology has the same meaning:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pressure Brick<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pressure Scanner</p>
<p class="Note">Scanners specified in the Management GUI ini file parameter PurgeIgnoreList do not appear in the list of purge channels in the Pressure Scanner Functions Panel.</p>
<p>Purging can be performed on all configured pressure scanner channels in the system before each test.</p>
<p class="Note">The enable purge channel is defined in the MgtGUI.ini file as:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;[PBS]<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purge Time = 30<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enable Purge Chan = Purge Enable<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purge Ignore List = PB131487<br>
  <br>
  If the channel listed as the enable purge channel (Purge Enable) is False, then the purge functions are disabled.</p>

  <li><a href="?99#PurgeOneBrick">purge one scanner</a></li>
  <li><a href="?100#ZeroAllBricks">zero all scanners</a></li>

<h4 id="AccessPBFunctionsPanel">Accessing the Pressure Scanner Functions Panel</h4>
<p>To access the Pressure Scanner Functions panel:</p>
<ol>
  <li>From the Management GUI Control Panel Tools menu, select <strong>PBS</strong>.<br>
    The Pressure Scanner Functions panel is displayed.<br>
    <div class="Container"><img src="images/PBS.png" width="698" height="648" alt=""/> </div>
  </li>
</ol>
<h4 id="PurgeAllBricks">Purge All Scanners</h4>
<p>The Purge All function allows the user to purge the pressure lines between the scanners and engine. The purge is performed on all configured pressure scanner channels.<br>
  <br>
  Purging the pressure scanner isolates the transducers from the measurement ports and connects the ports to an external purge connection (pressure source). Pressure is forced out of the measurement ports, removing any blockages or contaminants between the scanner and the pressure tapping on the engine. <br>
  <br>
  The pressure source is typically a conditioned air or nitrogen supply in the test cell.<br>
</p>
<p class="Caution">Do not purge scanners with the dust caps installed or with the measurement port sealed, as damage to the scanners will result.</p>
<p>To purge all scanners:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Enter the duration of the purge, in seconds, in the <strong>Purge Time</strong> field of the Pressure Scanner Functions panel.
    <p class="Note">The default purge time is 30 seconds. This time can be modified in the config.ini file.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Select <strong>Purge All Scanners</strong>.<br>
    A dialogue box is displayed, indicating the scanners are being purged.</li>
  <li>When all scanners have been purged, the dialogue box is closed and the operator is returned to the Pressure Scanner Functions panel. The pressure channels are returned to their normal measurement mode.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="PurgeOneBrick">Purge One Scanner</h4>
<p>The Purge One Scanner function allows the user to purge the pressure lines between a single pressure scanner and the engine.</p>
<p class="Caution">Do not purge scanners with the dust caps installed or with the measurement port sealed, as damage to the scanners will result.</p>
<p>To purge one scanner: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Enter the duration of the purge in the <strong>Purge Time</strong> field.</li>
  <li>Select <strong>Purge One Scanner</strong>.</li>
  <li>Select the name of a channel on the scanner to be purged from the Pressure Scanner Functions panel.</li>
  <li>Select <strong>Start</strong> or select <strong>Cancel</strong> to exit the purge one function.<br>
    A dialogue box is displayed, indicating the scanner is being purged.</li>
  <li>When the scanner has been purged, the dialogue box is closed and the operator is returned to the Pressure Scanner Functions panel.
    The pressure channels are returned to their normal measurement mode.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="ZeroAllBricks">Zero Scanners</h4>
<p>The zero calibration (Zero) command causes the pressure scanners to shift the internal calibration valves into the CAL position. The pressures that are present at the CAL and the CAL REF inputs are used for the minimum or zero calibration pressure. On completion of the zero calibration, the calibration valves are shifted into the RUN position and the offset coefficients are updated in pneumatic pressure scanner memory.</p>
<p>The Zero All function allows the user to zero all configured pressure scanners simultaneously, resulting in a recalculated offset coefficient for each of the channels being calibrated and automatically compensating for any drift errors in the transducer offset.</p>
<p class="Note">Since the coefficients do not get permanently stored in the scanner it is recommended that the zero command be performed prior to each engine test.</p>
<p>To zero all scanners:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select <strong>Zero All</strong> from the Pressure Scanner Functions panel.</li>
  <li>When the scanners have been zeroed, the UEL states that the task has been completed.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Zero Multiple function allows the user to zero multiple (at least one) configured pressure scanners simultaneously, resulting in a recalculated offset coefficient for each of the channels being calibrated and automatically compensating for any drift errors in the transducer offset.</p>
<p class="Note">Selecting one scanner will select all channels that are tied to that scanner.</p>
<p>To zero multiple scanners:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select <strong>Zero Multiple</strong> from the Pressure Scanner Functions panel.</li>
  <li>Select the scanners to be zeroed from the list in the Pressure Scanner Functions panel. Hold CTRL while selecting to select multiple scanners.</li>
  <li>Select <strong>Start</strong> or select <strong>Cancel</strong> to exit the purge one function.<br>
    A dialogue box is displayed, indicating the scanner is being purged.</li>
  <li>When the scanners have been zeroed, the dialogue box is closed and the operator is returned to the Pressure Scanner Functions panel, and the UEL states that the task has been completed.</li>
</ol>
