<h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The Trim Balance system is used in conjunction with the CEC Vibration Monitoring System that addresses engine vibration problems during test. 
  The system is configured to collect data at predetermined engine speeds from vibration monitoring hardware. The data is evaluated and displayed in table 
and plot formats in the form of a balancing solution. The solution directs an operator to place various Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) balance weights at specific locations on an engine fan Low Pressure Turbine (LPT) or high pressure compressor (Core). Similar to the balance weights on the wheel rims of a car, the weights and their distribution pattern trim or lower vibration that occurs at specific rotational speeds.</p>
<p>The system uses two types of data (vibration phase angle and amplitude), measured on up to 3 vibration transducers, to produce a balancing 
  solution for the fan, LPT or core. The balance weight part numbers and effective weights are presented to the user to allow for easy engine plane configuration. The solution is expressed with phase lag and sensitivity coefficients that indicate the response of the fan, LPT or core to the installed balance weights. The sensitivity coefficient is a measure of the amount of weight per unit of vibration change. It is used to calculate the magnitude of the weight to install. The phase lag is used to calculate the weight location. Vibration severity varies at different rotational speeds, thus several sets of coefficients are 
generated to calculate an overall balance solution. A record of coefficients is created after each successful balance. These coefficients apply to a family of engines, and are used to calculate the first weight (one-shot) solution during the next engine balance session.</p>
<p>The system allows the operator to view the cumulative effect of combining (summing) a balancing solution with another solution. Data from previous tests may also be retrieved.</p>
<p>Residual vibration is also predicted by Trim Balance after the software calculates the solution at the Residual Vibration Levels screen. At this screen, the operator may elect to provide a &quot;User&quot; weight solution. The user solution can, for example, be &quot;tuned&quot; for specific speeds, instead of using the &quot;MDS&quot; solution that is &quot;averaged&quot; for all speeds.</p>
<p>The system provides real time display of vibration amplitudes and phase angles. The Trim Balance System is configured to collect data at predetermined engine speeds from vibration monitoring hardware. The data is evaluated and displayed in table and plot formats in the form of a balancing solution. The vibration measurement system receives signals for the velocity transducers (voltage output), accelerometers with charge output (pC/g) and accelerometers with integral charge amplifiers (ICP type voltage outputs).</p>
<p>The CEC Vibration System tracks against either N1, N2, N3 vibration signals to produce relevant tracked orders. Additional vibration/trim balance displays are available to the test cell operator. The system reconfigures the CEC amplifiers to produce tracked order vibration and phase angle outputs. Tracking filters allow vibration levels that change with rotational speed to be analysed.</p>
<p>If an Endevco Vibration System is being used, the Trim Balance software can reconfigure the Endevco TFAS Vibration Signal Conditioner to Trim Balance 
mode allowing it to output the phase angle needed for engine balancing. The system restores the Endevco to initial values after balancing is complete.</p>
<p>During test, the system:</p>
<ul>
  <li>starts and stops test data logs at predetermined test speeds</li>
  <li>indicates data quality (good, suspect or bad) and automatically selects good data while excluding bad data</li>
  <li>expresses data in graphical and tabular form</li>
  <li>generates and retrieves reports</li>
  <li>updates sensitivity and phase lag coefficients to reflect test results for a specific family of engines</li>
  <li>records imbalance data at multiple speeds</li>
</ul>
<p>The process flow for a Fan or LPT balance session is displayed in the following flowchart.</p>
<div class="Container"><img src="images/BDTrimBalFlowA.gif" alt="BD Trim Balance FlowA" width="677" height="735"></div>
<br>
<p>The process flow for a Core balance session is displayed in the following flowchart.</p>
<div class="Container"><img src="images/BDCoreBalFlow.gif" alt="BD Core Balance Flow" width="689" height="843"></div>
<br>
<p>The system is configured with a unique tb log definition using the Transient Log Editor. A tb.def log file definition stores the channel identifiers that are used by the Trim Balance. The 'new' and 'specifics.ini' files, within the Trim Balance directory, identifies channels that proDAS uses to receive data for the test, and other engine-specific balance configuration settings.</p>
<p>The operator selects  up to three vibration transducers to be used for balancing. Each transducer requires an amplitude and phase angle channel assignment. The speed data channel is common to all sensors, thus, up to seven data channels may be required by proDAS per test. An auto-report configuration parameter is included within tb.def to convert data into a tab-delimited text file.</p>
<p>After the Record Data button is selected on the Vibration Measurement GUI, Trim Balance sends the command to proDAS to start and stop data acquisition in the tb log. proDAS creates a report from the data using tb.def that is sent to Trim Balance for analysis. The analysis results are displayed on the Imbalance Vector Data GUI. A balance weight solution (weights and their distribution pattern on the engine fan, LPT or core) is displayed on the Balance Weight Vector GUI.</p>
<p>The system resides on the Management Interface Computer and communicates with the Endevco AVM System via an IEEE 488 interface (i.e. GPIB connection), if applicable, and communicates with proDAS through an Ethernet link.</p>

<p>File Maintenance is a customer dependent file, therefore the report header information and the number of supported engines and engine types will vary. For each new software release, the version information must be updated. If necessary, a new config.ini file can be generated using the read-only config.ini.dot template (in the Templates folder). If a new config.ini file is generated, make sure the new config.ini file is saved as a flat text file.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>weighting factor assigned to each pickup (transducer). Values are specified for Fan and LPT balancing. Factors are grouped according to the transducers  used for balancing: Factors 0 &amp; 1 are used when balancing using TXs (transducers) 1 &amp; 2, factors 2 &amp; 3 are used for TXs 1 &amp; 3, factors 3 &amp; 4 are used for TXs 2 &amp; 3, and factors 6, 7 &amp; 8 are used for TXs 1, 2 and 3.

  <blockquote>
    <p><strong><em>x</em>&lt;plane&gt;Sens<em>y</em></strong>: sensitivity is the vibration response of the engine to one unit of applied weight. Sensitivities are of this form where plane is Fan or LPT, x (0 to 2) is the index of the transducer, and y is the index of the balance speed.

      <strong>Tables</strong>: a Boolean setting indicating if there are weight solution lookup tables available.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The TB Application assumes weight locations are evenly distributed around the balance plane. Some engines use some of these weight locations for bolts used to retain the Fan spinner. If this is the case, or if some of the holes are permanently unavailable by design, these locations are annotated in the Fan plane configuration section as: <strong>Part#<em>n</em></strong>=&quot;Spinner Hole&quot; at the appropriate <strong>Loc<em>n</em></strong>.</p>
<p> The new file is an engine dependent file. Improper modifications to this file will impair software functioning. Be careful when editing and saving changes to this file.</p>
<h3 id="TBRecentTemplateFile">Recent Template File (template.rct.txt)</h3>
<p><strong>File Path: proDAS\Data\Trimbal\coefficients.</strong></p>
<p>When a recent file is not found in the proDAS\Data\Trimbal\coefficients directory for the current engine type and the user level is greater than that of operator, this file (template.rct.txt) is used as a template for generating the engine name.rct.txt information. The software copies the template to a properly named file in the requisite folder, opens the new file with Notepad, allowing the user to enter the data in pre-specified fields. After the data has been entered, the user may then save the data (the file length is checked against the starting value) or exit Notepad without saving. If no additional information is added to the file or the user exits Notepad without saving, then the trim balance session will be aborted.</p>

<p>The first column in the lookup table (see Figure 4) is the effective weight of the solution. Columns 2 through 10 identify the balance weight part numbers required for 9 sequential hole locations. Column 6 coincides with the center hole location, columns 2 and 10 are four positions left and right, respectively, from the center hole.</p>
<p>This file is very format dependent. The position of the center column must always be respected. This position is used to map a blade number during the balance session. If this position is not at the right place, the balancing will be done but all solutions will have a angle shift.</p>
<p>The ON &amp; OFF file(s) should not require any maintenance. Lookup tables are engine specific. If lookup tables have been generated, ensure that the Tables Boolean key is set to true in the Units and Tables section of the new file for the specific engine type. New tables can be formulated using the TABLEmain.vi utility (refer to the Readme.txt file before starting).</p>
