<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The equipment racks house instrumentation, monitoring, and control equipment.</p>
<p>The equipment racks are typically located in the Instrumentation Room, and numbered from left to right. Equipment installed in the front of the rack is prefixed with the letter A, followed by the shelf number the equipment occupies. Similarly, equipment installed in back of the rack is prefixed with the letter B, followed by the shelf number the equipment occupies.</p>
<p class="Note">A shelf may be a platform on which the equipment sits, or the equipment that is bolted to the rack where a shelf would normally be located.</p>
<p>For example, the number IR3A2 locates the equipment in Instrumentation Room Rack 3 (IR3), at the front (A), on the second shelf from the top (2). Similarly, IR5B1 locates the equipment in Instrumentation Room Rack 5 (IR5), at the back (B), on the top shelf (1).</p>
<p class="Note">The shelves in a rack are normally numbered in sequence, from top to bottom (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.), but variations may occur.</p>
