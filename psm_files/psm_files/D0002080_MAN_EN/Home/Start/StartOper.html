<h2>Using the MDS Product Support Manual</h2>
<p>The MDS Product Support Manual (MDS PSM) is the user's primary source of reference information for the MDS delivered products. A user friendly <a href="#NavMenu">NavMenu</a> is always available at the left side of the viewer's screen. The user is able to quickly navigate via <a href="StartOverview.html?#Hyperlinks">Hyperlinks</a> (to jump) from one information module to another or, where applicable, to easily travel within the currently opened information module. The NavMenu is equipped with clearly marked main categories for quick navigation through the MDS Product Support Manual. A category represents a group of technical or non-technical information modules.</p>
<p>When a category has been selected, the respective group of topics is displayed under the category. When a topic has been selected (user has clicked on the topic text), the subject matter list is displayed. When selected, the subject matter is displayed in the main viewing area.</p>
<p>The following image shows the NavMenu expanded to show the specific subject matter for <em>Comms/Protocols -&gt; AFDX -&gt; Overview</em>. The AFDX&trade; Overview page is displayed in the main viewing area. (AFDX&trade; is a trademark of Airbus.)</p>

<h2 id="NavMenu">NavMenu</h2>
<p>The NavMenu is comprised of categories. These categories may be technical or non-technical. Each category contains topics. Each topic contains subject matter related specifically to that topic. The NavMenu expands and contracts (like an accordion) to display more or less information on the selected category or topic. The NavMenu has a dark grey background colour and white text.</p>
<h5>NavMenu Main Categories</h5>

The selected main category background colour changes from dark grey to blue, and the plus sign icon changes to a negative sign, indicating that the category has been expanded. Available topics for the selected category are displayed with a white background colour and black text.</p>
